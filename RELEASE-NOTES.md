### <a name="3.7.0-quoting"></a> Improved Parsing of Quoted Values
This release improves parser behaviour of quoted arguments:

* Quotes around command line parameters are now preserved by default (previously they were removed). This can be configured with `CommandLine::setTrimQuotes`.
* When [splitting](https://picocli.info/#_split_regex) parameters, quoted strings are no longer split. This can be configured with `CommandLine::setSplitQuotedStrings`.

Example:
```
@Option(names = "-x", split = ",")
String[] parts;
```

Given input like below:

```
<command> -x a,b,"c,d,e",f,"xxx,yyy"
```
This results in the `parts` array having the following values:
```
a
b
"c,d,e"
f
"xxx,yyy"
```

### <a name="3.7.0-picocli-codegen"></a> New Module `picocli-codegen`
Picocli Code Generation contains tools for generating source code, documentation and configuration files 
for picocli-based applications.

This release contains the `ReflectionConfigGenerator` class.
`ReflectionConfigGenerator` generates a JSON String with the program elements that will be accessed reflectively in a picocli-based application, in order to compile this application ahead-of-time into a native executable with GraalVM.

The output of `ReflectionConfigGenerator` is intended to be passed to the `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=/path/to/reflectconfig` option of the `native-image` GraalVM utility. This allows picocli-based applications to be compiled to a native image.

See [Picocli on GraalVM: Blazingly Fast Command Line Apps](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/wiki/Picocli-on-GraalVM:-Blazingly-Fast-Command-Line-Apps) for details.

The module's [README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/picocli-codegen/README.md) explains how to configure your build to generate the configuration file automatically as part of your build.


### <a name="3.7.0-picocli-shell-jline2"></a> New Module `picocli-shell-jline2`
Picocli Shell JLine2 contains components and documentation for building
interactive shell command line applications with JLine 2 and picocli.

This release contains the `PicocliJLineCompleter` class.
`PicocliJLineCompleter` is a small component that generates completion candidates to allow users to
get command line TAB auto-completion for a picocli-based application running in a JLine 2 shell.

See the module's [README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/picocli-shell-jline2/README.md) for more details.

## <a name="3.7.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

## <a name="3.6.0"></a> Table of Contents
* [New and noteworthy](#3.6.0-new)
* [Fixed issues](#3.6.0-fixes)
* [Deprecations](#3.6.0-deprecated)
* [Potential breaking changes](#3.6.0-breaking-changes)

## <a name="3.6.0-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
### Default Provider

This release allows you to specify a default provider in the `@Command` annotation:

```java
@Command(defaultValueProvider = MyDefaultProvider.class)
class MyCommand // ...
```

The default provider allows you to get default values from a configuration file or some other central place.
Default providers need to implement the `picocli.CommandLine.IDefaultValueProvider` interface:

```java
public interface IDefaultValueProvider {

    /**
     * Returns the default value for an option or positional parameter or {@code null}.
     * The returned value is converted to the type of the option/positional parameter
     * via the same type converter used when populating this option/positional
     * parameter from a command line argument.
     *
     * @param argSpec the option or positional parameter, never {@code null}
     * @return the default value for the option or positional parameter, or {@code null} if
     *       this provider has no default value for the specified option or positional parameter
     * @throws Exception when there was a problem obtaining the default value
     */
    String defaultValue(ArgSpec argSpec) throws Exception;
}
```

### `@Command` Methods
From picocli 3.6, methods can be annotated with `@Command`. The method parameters provide the command options and parameters. For example:

```java
class Cat {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommandLine.invoke("cat", Cat.class, args);
    }

    @Command(description = "Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.",
             mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "3.6.0")
    void cat(@Option(names = {"-E", "--show-ends"}) boolean showEnds,
             @Option(names = {"-n", "--number"}) boolean number,
             @Option(names = {"-T", "--show-tabs"}) boolean showTabs,
             @Option(names = {"-v", "--show-nonprinting"}) boolean showNonPrinting,
             @Parameters(paramLabel = "FILE") File[] files) {
        // process files
    }
}
```
The usage help of the above command looks like this:

```
Usage: cat [-EhnTvV] [FILE...]
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.
      [FILE...]
  -E, --show-ends
  -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
  -n, --number
  -T, --show-tabs
  -v, --show-nonprinting
  -V, --version            Print version information and exit.
```
See below for an example that uses a resource bundle to define usage help descriptions outside the code.

For positional parameters, the `@Parameters` annotation may be omitted on method parameters.

TIP: If compiled with the `-parameters` flag on Java 8 or higher, the `paramLabel` of positional parameters is obtained from the method parameter name using reflection instead of the generic arg0, arg1, etc.

#### Subcommand Methods

If the enclosing class is annotated with `@Command`, method commands are added as subcommands to the class command, unless the class command has attribute `@Command(addMethodSubcommands = false)`.
For example:

```java
@Command(name = "git", mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "picocli-3.6.0")
class Git {
    @Option(names = "--git-dir", descriptionKey = "GITDIR")
    Path path;

    @Command
    void commit(@Option(names = {"-m", "--message"}) String commitMessage,
                @Option(names = "--squash", paramLabel = "<commit>") String squash,
                @Parameters(paramLabel = "<file>") File[] files) {
        // ... implement business logic
    }
}
```

Use `@Command(addMethodSubcommands = false)` on the class `@Command` annotation if the `@Command`-annotated methods in this class should not be added as subcommands.

The usage help of the `git commit` command looks like this:

```
Usage: git commit [--squash=<commit>] [-m=<arg0>] [<file>...]
      [<file>...]
      --squash=<commit>
  -m, --message=<arg0>
```


### Internationalization

From version 3.6, usage help message sections and the description for options and positional parameters can be specified in a resource bundle. A resource bundle can be set via annotations and programmatically.

Annotation example:

```java
@Command(name = "i18n-demo", resourceBundle = "my.org.I18nDemo_Messages")
class I18nDemo {}
```

Programmatic example:

```java
@Command class I18nDemo2 {}

CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new I18nDemo2());
cmd.setResourceBundle(ResourceBundle.getBundle("my.org.I18nDemo2_Messages"));
```


Resources for multiple commands can be specified in a single ResourceBundle. Keys and their value can be shared by multiple commands (so you don't need to repeat them for every command), but keys can be prefixed with `fully qualified command name + "."` to specify different values for different commands. The most specific key wins. 

This is especially convenient for `@Command` methods where long description annotations would make the code less easy to read. 

You can use a resource bundle to move the descriptions out of the code:

```
# shared between all commands
help = Show this help message and exit.
version = Print version information and exit.

# command-specific strings
git.usage.description = Version control system
git.GITDIR = Set the path to the repository

git.commit.usage.description = Record changes to the repository
git.commit.message = Use the given <msg> as the commit message.
git.commit.squash = Construct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash.
git.commit.<file>[0..*] = The files to commit.
```

With this resource bundle, the usage help for the above `git commit` command looks like this:


```
Usage: git commit [--squash=<commit>] [-m=<arg0>] [<file>...]
Record changes to the repository
      [<file>...]         The files to commit.
      --squash=<commit>   Construct a commit message for use with rebase
                            --autosquash.
  -m, --message=<arg0>    Use the given <msg> as the commit message.
```

### Improved Error Messages

The error messages on invalid input have been improved. For example:

Previously, if an argument could not be converted to a primitive type, the error looked like this:

`Could not convert 'abc' to int for option '-num': java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"abc\"`

The new error message for primitive types looks like this:

`Invalid value for option '-num': 'abc' is not an int`

Previously, if an argument could not be converted to an enum, the error looked like this:

`Could not convert 'xyz' to TimeUnit for option '-timeUnit': java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.xyz`

The new error message for enums looks like this:

`Invalid value for option '-timeUnit': expected one of [NANOSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, MICROSECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS] but was 'xyz'`

# <a name="3.5.0"></a> Picocli 3.5.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.5.0.

This release contains new features, bugfixes and enhancements.

Password support: for options and positional parameters marked as `interactive`, the user is prompted to enter a value on the console.
When running on Java 6 or higher, picocli will use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Console.html#readPassword-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-"><code>Console.readPassword</code></a> API so that user input is not echoed to the console. 

Client code can now perform simple validation in annotated setter methods by throwing a `ParameterException` on invalid input. 

Also, from this release, the comment character in @-files (argument files) and the end-of-options delimiter (`--` by default) are configurable.


This is the thirty-sixth public release.

### <a name="3.5.0-passwords"></a><a name="3.5.0-interactive"></a> `Interactive` Options for Passwords or Passphrases
This release introduces password support: for options and positional parameters marked as `interactive`, the user is prompted to enter a value on the console.
When running on Java 6 or higher, picocli will use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Console.html#readPassword-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-"><code>Console.readPassword</code></a> API so that user input is not echoed to the console. 

Example usage:

```java
class Login implements Callable<Object> {
    @Option(names = {"-u", "--user"}, description = "User name")
    String user;

    @Option(names = {"-p", "--password"}, description = "Passphrase", interactive = true)
    String password;

    public Object call() throws Exception {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        md.update(password.getBytes());
        System.out.printf("Hi %s, your passphrase is hashed to %s.%n", user, base64(md.digest()));
        return null;
    }
    
    private String base64(byte[] arr) { /* ... */ }
}
```

When this command is invoked like this:

```java
CommandLine.call(new Login(), "-u", "user123", "-p");
```

Then the user will be prompted to enter a value:

```
Enter value for --password (Passphrase): 
```

When running on Java 6 or higher, the user input is not echoed to the console.
After the user enters a value and presses enter, the `call()` method is invoked, which prints the following:

```bash
Hi user123, your passphrase is hashed to 75K3eLr+dx6JJFuJ7LwIpEpOFmwGZZkRiB84PURz6U8=.
```

### <a name="3.5.0-validation"></a> Simple Validation in Setter Methods
Methods annotated with `@Option` and `@Parameters` can do simple input validation by throwing a `ParameterException` when invalid values are specified on the command line.

```java
class ValidationExample {
    private Map<String, String> properties = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    
    @Spec private CommandSpec spec; // injected by picocli
    
    @Option(names = {"-D", "--property"}, paramLabel = "KEY=VALUE")
    public void setProperty(Map<String, String> map) {
        for (String key : map.keySet()) {
            String newValue = map.get(key);
            validateUnique(key, newValue);
            properties.put(key, newValue);
        }
    }

    private void validateUnique(String key, String newValue) {
        String existing = properties.get(key);
        if (existing != null && !existing.equals(newValue)) {
            throw new ParameterException(spec.commandLine(),
                    String.format("Duplicate key '%s' for values '%s' and '%s'.",
                    key, existing, newValue));
        }
    }
}
```

Prior to this release, the exception thrown from the method was wrapped in a `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException`, which in turn was wrapped in a `PicocliException`, and finally in another `ParameterException`.

By following the recipe above and throwing a `ParameterException` on invalid input, all these intermediate exceptions are skipped.

### `UnmatchedArgumentException` Improvements
The `UnmatchedArgumentException` class now has several methods that allow an application to offer suggestions for fixes to the end user.

For example:
```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "--file") File[] files;
    @Option(names = "--find") String pattern;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        App app = new App();
        try {
            new CommandLine(app).parse(args);
            // ...
            
        } catch (ParameterException ex) {
            System.err.println(ex.getMessage());
            if (!UnmatchedArgumentException.printSuggestions(ex, System.err)) { // new API
                ex.getCommandLine().usage(System.err, ansi);
            }
        }
    } 
}
```

If you run this class with an invalid option that is similar to an actual option, the `UnmatchedArgumentException.printSuggestions` method will show the actual options. For example:

```
<cmd> -fi
```

Prints this output:

```
Unknown option: -fi
Possible solutions: --file, --find
```

This is the behaviour for the `CommandLine` convenience methods `run`, `call` and `parseWithHandlers`. 
Note that if possible fixes are found, the usage help message is not displayed.

# <a name="3.2.0"></a> Picocli 3.2.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.2.0.

This release contains new features and enhancements:

* Improved support for Dependency Injection
* Methods can now be annotated with `@Option` and `@Parameters`
* Support for JLine-based interactive command line interfaces (`completionCandidates` attribute on `@Option` and `@Parameters`, and the `AutoComplete.complete` method)
* New `@Spec` annotation for injecting a command with its `CommandSpec`

This is the thirty-third public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### <a name="3.2.0-di"></a> Dependency Injection
This release makes integration with Dependency Injection containers extremely easy:

* `CommandLine` constructor now accepts a `Class` instance as the user object, and will delegate to the `IFactory` to get an instance.
* New `CommandLine.run(Class<Runnable>, IFactory, ...)` and `CommandLine.call(Class<Callable>, IFactory, ...)` methods. These work the same as the existing `run` and `call` methods except that the `Runnable` or `Callable` instance is created by the factory.

The below example shows how to create an `IFactory` implementation with a Guice `Injector`:

```java
import com.google.inject.*;
import picocli.CommandLine.IFactory;

public class GuiceFactory implements IFactory {
    private final Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new DemoModule());

    @Override
    public <K> K create(Class<K> aClass) throws Exception {
        return injector.getInstance(aClass);
    }

    static class DemoModule extends AbstractModule {
        @Override
        protected void configure() {
            bind(java.util.List.class).to(java.util.LinkedList.class);
            bind(Runnable.class).to(InjectionDemo.class);
        }
    }
}
```


Use the custom factory when creating a `CommandLine` instance, or when invoking the `run` or `call` convenience methods:

```java
import javax.inject.Inject;

@Command(name = "di-demo")
public class InjectionDemo implements Runnable {
    @Inject java.util.List list;

    @Option(names = "-x") int x;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommandLine.run(Runnable.class, new GuiceFactory(), args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        assert list instanceof java.util.LinkedList;
    }
}
```


### <a name="3.2.0-method-annotations"></a> Annotated Methods
From this release, `@Option` and `@Parameter` annotations can be added to methods as well as fields of a class.

For concrete classes, annotate "setter" methods (methods that accept a parameter) and when the option is specified on the command line, picocli will invoke the method with the value specified on the command line, converted to the type of the method parameter.

Alternatively, you may annotate "getter-like" methods (methods that return a value) on an interface, and picocli will create an instance of the interface that returns the values specified on the command line, converted to the method return type. This feature is inspired by [Jewel CLI](https://github.com/lexicalscope/jewelcli).

#### Annotating Methods of an Interface
The `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations can be used on methods of an interface that return a value. For example:

```java
interface Counter {
    @Option(names = "--count")
    int getCount();
}
```
You use it by specifying the class of the interface:
```java
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(Counter.class); // specify a class
String[] args = new String[] {"--count", "3"};
cmd.parse(args);
Counter counter = cmd.getCommand(); // picocli created an instance
assert counter.getCount() == 3; // method returns command line value
```

#### Annotating Methods of a Concrete Class
The `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations can be used on methods of a class that accept a parameter. For example:

```java
class Counter {
    int count;
    
    @Option(names = "--count")
    void setCount(int count) {
        this.count = count;
    }
}
```
You use it by passing an instance of the class:
```java
Counter counter = new Counter(); // the instance to populate
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(counter);
String[] args = new String[] {"--count", "3"};
cmd.parse(args);
assert counter.count == 3; // method was invoked with command line value
```

### <a name="3.2.0-jline"></a> JLine Tab-Completion Support

This release adds support for JLine Tab-Completion.

[Jline 2.x](https://github.com/jline/jline2) and [3.x](https://github.com/jline/jline3) is a Java library for handling console input, often used to create interactive shell applications.

Command line applications based on picocli can generate completion candidates for the command line in the JLine shell. The generated completion candidates are context sensitive, so once a subcommand is specified, only the options for that subcommand are shown, and once an option is specified, only parameters for that option are shown.

Below is an example picocli `Completer` implementation for JLine 2.x:

```java
import jline.console.completer.ArgumentCompleter;
import jline.console.completer.Completer;
import picocli.AutoComplete;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.Model.CommandSpec;

import java.util.List;

public class PicocliJLineCompleter implements Completer {
    private final CommandSpec spec;

    public PicocliJLineCompleter(CommandSpec spec) {
        this.spec = spec;
    }

    @Override
    public int complete(String buffer, int cursor, List<CharSequence> candidates) {
        // use the jline internal parser to split the line into tokens
        ArgumentCompleter.ArgumentList list =
                new ArgumentCompleter.WhitespaceArgumentDelimiter().delimit(buffer, cursor);

        // let picocli generate completion candidates for the token where the cursor is at
        return AutoComplete.complete(spec,
                list.getArguments(),
                list.getCursorArgumentIndex(),
                list.getArgumentPosition(),
                cursor,
                candidates);
    }
}
```

### <a name="3.2.0-completion-candidates"></a> Completion Candidates
From this release, `@Options` and `@Parameters` have a new `completionCandidates` attribute that can be used to generate a list of completions for this option or positional parameter. For example:

```java
static class MyAbcCandidates extends ArrayList<String> {
    MyAbcCandidates() { super(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C")); }
}

class ValidValuesDemo {
    @Option(names = "-o", completionCandidates = MyAbcCandidates.class)
    String option;
}
```

This will generate completion option values `A`, `B` and `C` in the generated bash auto-completion script and in JLine.


### <a name="3.2.0-default-variable"></a> `${DEFAULT-VALUE}` Variable
From picocli 3.2, it is possible to embed the default values in the description for an option or positional parameter by
specifying the variable `${DEFAULT-VALUE}` in the description text.
Picocli uses reflection to get the default values from the annotated fields.

The variable is replaced with the default value regardless of the `@Command(showDefaultValues)` attribute
and regardless of the `@Option(showDefaultValues)` or `@Parameters(showDefaultValues)` attribute.

```java
class DefaultValues {
    @Option(names = {"-f", "--file"},
            description = "the file to use (default: ${DEFAULT-VALUE})")
    File file = new File("config.xml");
}

CommandLine.usage(new DefaultValues(), System.out);
```
This produces the following usage help:
```text
Usage: <main class> -f=<file>
  -f, --file=<file>   the file to use (default: config.xml)
```

### <a name="3.2.0-completion-variable"></a>  `${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}` Variable
Similarly, it is possible to embed the completion candidates in the description for an option or positional parameter by
specifying the variable `${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}` in the description text.

This works for java `enum` classes and for options or positional parameters of non-enum types for which completion candidates are specified.

```java
enum Lang { java, groovy, kotlin, javascript, frege, clojure }

static class MyAbcCandidates extends ArrayList<String> {
    MyAbcCandidates() { super(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C")); }
}

class ValidValuesDemo {
    @Option(names = "-l", description = "Enum. Values: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}")
    Lang lang = null;

    @Option(names = "-o", completionCandidates = MyAbcCandidates.class,
            description = "Candidates: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}")
    String option;
}

CommandLine.usage(new ValidValuesDemo(), System.out);
```
This produces the following usage help:
```text
Usage: <main class> -l=<lang> -o=<option>
  -l=<lang>     Enum. Values: java, groovy, kotlin, javascript, frege, clojure
  -o=<option>   Candidates: A, B, C
```

### <a name="3.2.0-Spec"></a> `@Spec` Annotation  
A new `@Spec` annotation is now available that injects the `CommandSpec` model of the command into a command field.

This is useful when a command needs to use the picocli API, for example to walk the command hierarchy and iterate over its sibling commands.
This complements the `@ParentCommand` annotation;  the `@ParentCommand` annotation injects a user-defined command object, whereas this annotation injects a picocli class.
  
```java
class InjectSpecExample implements Runnable {
   @Spec CommandSpec commandSpec;
   //...
   public void run() {
       // do something with the injected spec
   }
}
  
```  
  
  
  

### <a name="3.2.0-lenient-parse"></a> Lenient Parse Mode

This release adds the ability to continue parsing invalid input to the end.
When `collectErrors` is set to `true`, and a problem occurs during parsing, an `Exception` is added to the `ParseResult.errors()` list and parsing continues. The default behaviour (when `collectErrors` is `false`) is to abort parsing by throwing the `Exception`.

This is useful when generating completion candidates on partial input, and is also useful when using picocli in
languages like Clojure where idiomatic error handling does not involve throwing and catching exceptions.

When using this feature, applications are responsible for actively verifying that no errors occurred before executing the business logic. Use with care!

## <a name="3.0.1-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
From this release, the usage help synopsis of the subcommand shows not only the subcommand name but also the parent command name. For example, take the following hierarchy of subcommands.

```java
@Command(name = "main", subcommands = {Sub.class}) class App { }
@Command(name = "sub", subcommands = {SubSub.class}) class Sub { }
@Command(name = "subsub", mixinStandardHelpOptions = true) class SubSub { }

CommandLine parser = new CommandLine(new App());
ParseResult result = parser.parseArgs("sub", "subsub", "--help");
CommandLine.printHelpIfRequested(result);
```
The above code prints the usage help for the `subsub` nested subcommand. Notice that this shows not only the subcommand name but the full command hierarchy:

```
Usage: main sub subsub [-hV]
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
```

# <a name="3.0.0"></a> Picocli 3.0.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.0.0.

This release offers a [programmatic API](http://picocli.info/picocli-3.0-programmatic-api.html) for creating command line applications, in addition to the annotations API. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages. The picocli community is proud to announce that [Apache Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)'s [CliBuilder](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/gapi/groovy/cli/picocli/CliBuilder.html) DSL for command line applications has been rewritten to use the picocli programmatic API, starting from Groovy 2.5.

Another new feature in this release are Mixins. Mixins allow reusing common options, parameters and command attributes in multiple applications without copy-and-paste duplication.

This release aims to reduce boilerplate code in user applications even further with the new `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. Picocli adds standard `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to commands with this attribute. Additionally picocli now offers a `HelpCommand` that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands.

From this release, picocli is better at following unix conventions: by default it now prints to stdout when the user requested help, and prints to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred. This release also gives better control over the process exit code.

A new `@Unmatched` annotation allows applications to easily capture unmatched arguments (arguments that could not be matched with any of the registered options or positional parameters).

Usage help message improvements: the usage help message width is now configurable, and the message layout is improved to reduce horizontal padding. Furthermore, you can now specify for individual options or positional parameters whether their default value should be shown in the description or hidden.

Finally, this release adds several options to configure parser behaviour. Picocli can now be configured to function like Apache Commons CLI, to facilitate migration from Apache Commons CLI to picocli.


This is the twenty-ninth public release.

### <a name="3.0.0-Programmatic-API"></a> Programmatic API
This release offers a programmatic API for creating command line applications, in addition to the annotations API. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages. (Example: Groovy [CliBuilder](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/gapi/groovy/cli/picocli/CliBuilder.html).)

_If you have suggestions for improving the programmatic API, please raise a ticket on GitHub!_

#### Example
```java
CommandSpec spec = CommandSpec.create();

#### CommandSpec
`CommandSpec` models a command. It is the programmatic variant of the `@Command` annotation. It has a name and a version, both of which may be empty.  It also has a `UsageMessageSpec` to configure aspects of the usage help message and a `ParserSpec` that can be used to control the behaviour of the parser.

#### OptionSpec and PositionalParamSpec
`OptionSpec` models a named option, and `PositionalParamSpec` models one or more positional parameters. They are the programmatic variant of the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations, respectively.

An `OptionSpec` must have at least one name, which is used during parsing to match command line arguments. Other attributes can be left empty and picocli will give them a reasonable default value. This defaulting is why `OptionSpec` objects are created with a builder: this allows you to specify only some attributes and let picocli initialise the other attributes. For example, if only the option’s name is specified, picocli assumes the option takes no parameters (arity = 0), and is of type `boolean`. Another example, if arity is larger than `1`, picocli sets the type to `List` and the `auxiliary type` to `String`.

`PositionalParamSpec` objects don’t have names, but have an index range instead. A single `PositionalParamSpec` object can capture multiple positional parameters. The default index range is set to `0..*` (all indices). A command may have multiple `PositionalParamSpec` objects to capture positional parameters at different index ranges. This can be useful if positional parameters at different index ranges have different data types.

Similar to `OptionSpec` objects, Once a `PositionalParamSpec` is constructed, its configuration becomes immutable, but its `value` can still be modified. Usually the value is set during command line parsing when a non-option command line argument is encountered at a position in its index range.

#### <a name="3.0.0-ParseResult"></a> ParseResult
A `ParseResult` class is now available that allows applications to inspect the result of parsing a sequence of command line arguments.

This class provides methods to query whether the command line arguments included certain options or position parameters, and what the value or values of these options and positional parameters was. Both the original command line argument String value as well as a strongly typed value can be obtained.


### Mixins for Reuse
Mixins are a convenient alternative to subclassing: picocli annotations from _any_ class can be added to ("mixed in" with) another command. This includes options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes. Picocli [autoHelp](#3.0.0-alpha-1-autohelp) internally uses a mixin.

A mixin is a separate class with options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes that can be reused in other commands. Mixins can be installed by calling the `CommandLine.addMixin` method with an object of this class, or annotating a field in your command with `@Mixin`. Here is an example mixin class:

```java
public class ReusableOptions {

    @Option(names = { "-v", "--verbose" }, description = {
        "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.", "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`" })
    protected boolean[] verbosity = new boolean[0];
}
```

#### Adding Mixins Programmatically
The below example shows how a mixin can be added programmatically with the `CommandLine.addMixin` method.

```java
CommandLine commandLine = new CommandLine(new MyCommand());
commandline.addMixin("myMixin", new ReusableOptions());
```
#### `@Mixin` Annotation
A command can also include mixins by annotating fields with `@Mixin`. All picocli annotations found in the mixin class are added to the command that has a field annotated with `@Mixin`. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "zip", description = "Example reuse with @Mixin annotation.")
public class MyCommand {

    // adds the options defined in ReusableOptions to this command
    @Mixin
    private ReusableOptions myMixin;
}
```


### <a name="3.0.0-mixinStandardHelpOptions"></a> Standard Help Options
This release introduces the `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. When this attribute is set to `true`, picocli adds a mixin to the command that adds `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to the command. For example:

```java
@Command(mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "auto help demo - picocli 3.0")
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```

Commands with `mixinStandardHelpOptions` do not need to explicitly declare fields annotated with `@Option(usageHelp = true)` and `@Option(versionHelp = true)` any more. The usage help message for the above example looks like this:
```text
Usage: <main class> [-hV] [--option=<option>]
      --option=<option>   Some option.
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.
```

### <a name="3.0.0-HelpCommand"></a> Help Command

From this release, picocli provides a `help` subcommand (`picocli.CommandLine.HelpCommand`) that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands. For example:

```java
@Command(subcommands = HelpCommand.class)
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```


```text
# print help for the `maincommand` command
maincommand help

# print help for the `subcommand` command
maincommand help subcommand
```

For applications that want to create a custom help command, this release also introduces a new interface `picocli.CommandLine.IHelpCommandInitializable` that provides custom help commands with the information they need: access to the parent command and sibling commands, whether to use Ansi colors or not, and the streams to print the usage help message to.

### <a name="3.0.0-Unmatched"></a> `@Unmatched` Annotation
Unmatched arguments are the command line arguments that could not be assigned to any of the defined options or positional parameters. From this release, fields annotated with `@Unmatched` will be populated with the unmatched arguments. The field must be of type `String[]` or `List<String>`.

If picocli finds a field annotated with `@Unmatched`, it automatically sets `unmatchedArgumentsAllowed` to `true` so no `UnmatchedArgumentException` is thrown when a command line argument cannot be assigned to an option or positional parameter.

### <a name="3.0.0-std"></a> Stdout or Stderr
From picocli v3.0, the `run` and `call` convenience methods follow unix conventions: print to stdout when the user requested help, and print to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred.

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to facilitate following this convention. `AbstractHandler` also provides `useOut` and `useErr` methods to allow customizing the target output streams, and `useAnsi` to customize the Ansi style to use:

```java
@Command class CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { ... }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo());

        PrintStream myOut = getOutputPrintStream(); // custom stream to send command output to
        PrintStream myErr = getErrorPrintStream();  // custom stream for error messages

        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().useOut(myOut).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.ON),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().useErr(myErr).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.OFF),
                args);
    }
}
```

### <a name="3.0.0-exit-code"></a> Exit Code Support
From picocli v3.0, the built-in parse result handlers (`RunFirst`, `RunLast` and `RunAll`) and exception handler (`DefaultExceptionHandler`) can specify an exit code. If an exit code was specified, the handler terminates the JVM with the specified status code when finished.

```java
@Command class ExitCodeDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { throw new ParameterException(new CommandLine(this), "exit code demo"); }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new ExitCodeDemo());
        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().andExit(123),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().andExit(456),
                args);
    }
}
```
Running this command prints the following to stderr and exits the JVM with status code `456`.

```
exit code demo
Usage: <main class>
```

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to inherit this behaviour.


### <a name="3.0.0-ShowDefault"></a> Fine-grained ShowDefault

This release adds a `showDefaultValue` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotation. This allows you to specify for each individual option and positional parameter whether its default value should be shown in the usage help.

This attribute accepts three values:

* `ALWAYS` - always display the default value of this option or positional parameter, even `null` values, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `NEVER` - don't show the default value for this option or positional parameter, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `ON_DEMAND` - (this is the default) only show the default value for this option or positional parameter if `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command

The `NEVER` value is useful for security sensitive command line arguments like passwords. The `ALWAYS` value is useful when you only want to show the default value for a few arguments but not for all (in combination with `@Command(showDefaultValues = false)`).

### <a name="3.0.0-UsageHelpLayout"></a> Improved Usage Help Message Layout
Previously, the usage message layout had a fixed width long option name column: this column is always 24 characters, even if none of the options have a long option name.

This gave strange-looking usage help messages in some cases. For example:
```java
@Command(name="ls")
class App {
    @Option(names = "-a", description = "display all files") boolean a;
    @Option(names = "-l", description = "use a long listing format") boolean l;
    @Option(names = "-t", description = "sort by modification time") boolean t;
}
```

The usage message for this example was:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a                          display all files
  -l                          use a long listing format
  -t                          sort by modification time
```
From this release, picocli adjusts the width of the long option name column to the longest name (up to max 24).

The new usage message for this example looks like this:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a     display all files
  -l     use a long listing format
  -t     sort by modification time
```

### <a name="3.0.0-StricterArity"></a> Stricter Arity Validation

Until this release, options with mandatory parameters would consume as many arguments as required, even if those arguments matched other option flags. For example:

Given a command like this:
```java
class App {
  @Option(names = "-a", arity = "2")
  String[] a;
  
  @Option(names = "-v")
  boolean v;
}
```
Prior to this change, the following input would be accepted:
```
<command> -a 1 -v
```
In previous versions, picocli accepted this and assigned `"1"` and `"-v"` as the two values for the `-a` option.
From this release, the parser notices that one of the arguments is an option and throws a `MissingParameterException` because not enough parameters were specified for the first option.

## <a name="3.0.0-beta-2-new"></a> New and Noteworthy

### Stricter Arity Validation

Until this release, options with mandatory parameters would consume as many arguments as required, even if those arguments matched other option flags. For example:

Given a command like this:
```java
class App {
  @Option(names = "-a", arity = "2")
  String[] a;
  
  @Option(names = "-v")
  boolean v;
}
```
Prior to this change, the following input would be accepted:
```
<command> -a 1 -v
```
In previous versions, picocli accepted this and assigned `"1"` and `"-v"` as the two values for the `-a` option.
From this release, the parser notices that one of the arguments is an option and throws a `MissingParameterException` because not enough parameters were specified for the first option.

## <a name="3.0.0-beta-1-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
Previously, the usage message layout had a fixed width long option name column: this column is always 24 characters, even if none of the options have a long option name.

This gives weird-looking usage help messages in some cases. For example:
```java
@Command(name="ls")
class App {
    @Option(names = "-a", description = "display all files") boolean a;
    @Option(names = "-l", description = "use a long listing format") boolean l;
    @Option(names = "-t", description = "sort by modification time") boolean t;
}
```

The usage message for this example was:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a                          display all files
  -l                          use a long listing format
  -t                          sort by modification time
```
From this release, picocli adjusts the width of the long option name column to the longest name (max 24).

The new usage message for this example looks like this:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a     display all files
  -l     use a long listing format
  -t     sort by modification time
```

### Max Arity Is Max Total Params

This release introduces a `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` parser configuration option.

By default, the arity of an option is the number of arguments _for each occurrence_ of the option.
For example, if option `-a` has `arity = "2"`, then the following is a perfectly valid command:
for each occurrence of the option, two option parameters are specified.
```bash
<command> -a 1 2 -a 3 4 -a 5 6
```
However, if `CommandLine.setMaxArityIsMaxTotalParams(true)` is called first, the above example would result in a `MaxValuesExceededException` because the total number of values (6) exceeds the arity of 2.

Additionally, by default, when `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` is `false`, arity is only applied _before_ the argument is split into parts,
while when `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` is set to `true`, validation is applied _after_ a command line argument has been split into parts.

For example, if we have an option like this:
```java
@Option(name = "-a", arity = "1..2", split = ",") String[] values;
```
By default, the following input would be a valid command:
```bash
<command> -a 1,2,3
```
By default, the option arity tells the parser to consume 1 to 2 arguments, and the option was followed by a single parameter, `"1,2,3"`, which is fine.

However, if `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` is set to true, the above example would result in a `MaxValuesExceededException` because the argument is split into 3 parts, which exceeds the max arity of 2.

# <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1"></a> Picocli 3.0.0-alpha-1
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.0.0-alpha-1.

This release offers a programmatic API for creating command line applications, in addition to annotations. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages.

Another new feature in this release are Mixins. Mixins allow reusing common options, parameters and command attributes in multiple applications without copy-and-paste duplication.

Third, this release aims to reduce boilerplate code in user applications even further with the new `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. Picocli adds standard `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to commands with this attribute. Additionally picocli now offers a `HelpCommand` that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands.

From this release, picocli is better at following unix conventions: print to stdout when the user requested help, and print to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred.

Also, this release gives better control over the process exit code.

Additionally, fields annotated with `@Unmatched` will be populated with the unmatched arguments.

Furthermore, this release adds a `showDefaultValue` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotation.

This is the twenty-first public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-Programmatic-API"></a> Programmatic API (INCUBATING)
This release offers a programmatic API for creating command line applications, in addition to annotations. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages.

Note that the programmatic API is incubating and the API may change in subsequent releases. _If you have suggestions for improving the programmatic API, please raise a ticket on GitHub!_

#### Example
```java
CommandSpec spec = CommandSpec.create();
spec.mixinStandardHelpOptions(true); // usageHelp and versionHelp options
spec.addOption(OptionSpec.builder("-c", "--count")
        .paramLabel("COUNT")
        .type(int.class)
        .description("number of times to execute").build());
spec.addPositional(PositionalParamSpec.builder()
        .paramLabel("FILES")
        .type(List.class)
        .auxiliaryTypes(File.class) // List<File>
        .description("The files to process").build());
CommandLine commandLine = new CommandLine(spec);

commandLine.parseWithSimpleHandlers(new AbstractSimpleParseResultHandler() {
    public void handle(ParseResult pr) {
        int count = pr.optionValue('c', 1);
        List<File> files = pr.positionalValue(0, Collections.<File>emptyList());
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            for (File f : files) {
                System.out.printf("%d: %s%n", i, f);
            }
        }
    }
}, args);
```

#### CommandSpec (INCUBATING)
`CommandSpec` models a command. It is the programmatic variant of the `@Command` annotation. It has a name and a version, both of which may be empty.  It also has a `UsageMessageSpec` to configure aspects of the usage help message and a `ParserSpec` that can be used to control the behaviour of the parser.

#### OptionSpec and PositionalParamSpec (INCUBATING)
`OptionSpec` models a named option, and `PositionalParamSpec` models one or more positional parameters. They are the programmatic variant of the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations, respectively.

An `OptionSpec` must have at least one name, which is used during parsing to match command line arguments. Other attributes can be left empty and picocli will give them a reasonable default value. This defaulting is why `OptionSpec` objects are created with a builder: this allows you to specify only some attributes and let picocli initialise the other attributes. For example, if only the option’s name is specified, picocli assumes the option takes no parameters (arity = 0), and is of type `boolean`. Another example, if arity is larger than `1`, picocli sets the type to `List` and the `auxiliary type` to `String`.

`PositionalParamSpec` objects don’t have names, but have an index range instead. A single `PositionalParamSpec` object can capture multiple positional parameters. The default index range is set to `0..*` (all indices). A command may have multiple `PositionalParamSpec` objects to capture positional parameters at different index ranges. This can be useful if positional parameters at different index ranges have different data types.

Similar to `OptionSpec` objects, Once a `PositionalParamSpec` is constructed, its configuration becomes immutable, but its `value` can still be modified. Usually the value is set during command line parsing when a non-option command line argument is encountered at a position in its index range.

#### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-ParseResult"></a> ParseResult (INCUBATING)
A `ParseResult` class is now available that allows applications to inspect the result of parsing a sequence of command line arguments.

This class provides methods to query whether the command line arguments included certain options or position parameters, and what the value or values of these options and positional parameters was. Both the original command line argument String value as well as a strongly typed value can be obtained.


### Mixins for Reuse
Mixins are a convenient alternative to subclassing: picocli annotations from _any_ class can be added to ("mixed in" with) another command. This includes options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes. Picocli [autoHelp](#3.0.0-alpha-1-autohelp) internally uses a mixin.

A mixin is a separate class with options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes that can be reused in other commands. Mixins can be installed by calling the `CommandLine.addMixin` method with an object of this class, or annotating a field in your command with `@Mixin`. Here is an example mixin class:

```java
public class ReusableOptions {

    @Option(names = { "-v", "--verbose" }, description = {
        "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.", "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`" })
    protected boolean[] verbosity = new boolean[0];
}
```

#### Adding Mixins Programmatically
The below example shows how a mixin can be added programmatically with the `CommandLine.addMixin` method.

```java
CommandLine commandLine = new CommandLine(new MyCommand());
commandline.addMixin("myMixin", new ReusableOptions());
```
#### `@Mixin` Annotation
A command can also include mixins by annotating fields with `@Mixin`. All picocli annotations found in the mixin class
are added to the command that has a field annotated with `@Mixin`. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "zip", description = "Example reuse with @Mixin annotation.")
public class MyCommand {

    // adds the options defined in ReusableOptions to this command
    @Mixin
    private ReusableOptions myMixin;
}
```


### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-mixinStandardHelpOptions"></a> Standard Help Options
This release introduces the `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. When this attribute is set to `true`, picocli adds a mixin to the command that adds `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to the command. For example:

```java
@Command(mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "auto help demo - picocli 3.0")
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```

Commands with `mixinStandardHelpOptions` do not need to explicitly declare fields annotated with `@Option(usageHelp = true)` and `@Option(versionHelp = true)` any more. The usage help message for the above example looks like this:
```text
Usage: <main class> [-hV] [--option=<option>]
      --option=<option>       Some option.
  -h, --help                  Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version               Print version information and exit.
```

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-HelpCommand"></a> Help Command

From this release, picocli provides a `help` subcommand (`picocli.CommandLine.HelpCommand`) that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands. For example:

```java
@Command(subcommands = HelpCommand.class)
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```


```text
# print help for the `maincommand` command
maincommand help

# print help for the `subcommand` command
maincommand help subcommand
```

For applications that want to create a custom help command, this release also introduces a new interface `picocli.CommandLine.IHelpCommandInitializable` that provides custom help commands with the information they need: access to the parent command and sibling commands, whether to use Ansi colors or not, and the streams to print the usage help message to.

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-Unmatched"></a> `@Unmatched` Annotation
From this release, fields annotated with `@Unmatched` will be populated with the unmatched arguments.
The field must be of type `String[]` or `List<String>`.

If picocli finds a field annotated with `@Unmatched`, it automatically sets `unmatchedArgumentsAllowed` to `true`
so no `UnmatchedArgumentException` is thrown when a command line argument cannot be assigned to an option or positional parameter.

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-std"></a> Stdout or Stderr
From picocli v3.0, the `run` and `call` convenience methods follow unix conventions:
print to stdout when the user requested help, and print to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred.

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to facilitate following this convention.
`AbstractHandler` also provides `useOut` and `useErr` methods to allow customizing the target output streams,
and `useAnsi` to customize the Ansi style to use:

```java
@Command class CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { ... }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo());

        PrintStream myOut = getOutputPrintStream(); // custom stream to send command output to
        PrintStream myErr = getErrorPrintStream();  // custom stream for error messages

        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().useOut(myOut).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.ON),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().useErr(myErr).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.OFF),
                args);
    }
}
```

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-exit-code"></a> Exit Code Support
From picocli v3.0, the built-in parse result handlers (`RunFirst`, `RunLast` and `RunAll`) and exception handler
(`DefaultExceptionHandler`) can specify an exit code.
If an exit code was specified, the handler terminates the JVM with the specified status code when finished.

```java
@Command class ExitCodeDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { throw new ParameterException(new CommandLine(this), "exit code demo"); }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new ExitCodeDemo());
        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().andExit(123),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().andExit(456),
                args);
    }
}
```
Running this command prints the following to stderr and exits the JVM with status code `456`.

```
exit code demo
Usage: <main class>
```

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to inherit this behaviour.


### Fine-grained ShowDefault

This release adds a `showDefaultValue` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotation. This allows you to specify for each individual option and positional parameter whether its default value should be shown in the usage help.

This attribute accepts three values:

* `ALWAYS` - always display the default value of this option or positional parameter, even `null` values, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `NEVER` - don't show the default value for this option or positional parameter, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `ON_DEMAND` - (this is the default) only show the default value for this option or positional parameter if `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command

The `NEVER` value is useful for security sensitive command line arguments like passwords. The `ALWAYS` value is useful when you only want to show the default value for a few arguments but not for all (in combination with `@Command(showDefaultValues = false)`).

# <a name="2.3.0"></a> Picocli 2.3.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.3.0.

This release contains bugfixes and new features.

This release introduces a new parser flag `stopAtPositional` to treat the first positional parameter as end-of-options, and a `stopAtUnmatched` parser flag to stop matching options and positional parameters as soon as an unmatched argument is encountered.

These flags are useful for applications that need to delegate part of the command line to third party commands.

This release offers better support for options with optional values, allowing applications to distinguish between cases where the option was not specified at all, and cases where the option was specified without a value.


This is the twentieth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

* [Potential breaking changes](#2.3.0-breaking-changes)

## <a name="2.3.0-new"></a> New and noteworthy

### Stop At Positional
By default, positional parameters can be mixed with options on the command line, but this is not always desirable. From this release, applications can call `CommandLine.setStopAtPositional(true)` to force the parser to treat all values following the first positional parameter as positional parameters.

When this flag is set, the first positional parameter effectively serves as an "end of options" marker, without requiring a separate `--` argument.

### Stop At Unmatched
From this release, applications can call `CommandLine.setStopAtUnmatched(true)` to force the parser to stop interpreting options and positional parameters as soon as it encounters an unmatched argument.

When this flag is set, the first unmatched argument and all subsequent command line arguments are added to the unmatched arguments list returned by `CommandLine.getUnmatchedArguments()`.


### Optional Values
If an option is defined with `arity = "0..1"`, it may or not have a parameter value. If such an option is specified without a value on the command line, it is assigned an empty String. If the option is not specified, it keeps its default value. For example:

```java
class OptionalValueDemo implements Runnable {
    @Option(names = "-x", arity = "0..1", description = "optional parameter")
    String x;

    public void run() { System.out.printf("x = '%s'%n", x); }

    public static void main(String... args) {
       CommandLine.run(new OptionalValueDemo(), System.out, args);
    }
}
```
Gives the following results:
```bash
java OptionalValueDemo -x value
x = 'value'

java OptionalValueDemo -x
x = ''

java OptionalValueDemo
x = 'null'
```

# <a name="2.2.0"></a> Picocli 2.2.0

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.2.

This release is a "Project Coin"-like release for picocli: small changes with a nice pay-off.


In command line applications with subcommands, options of the parent command are often intended as "global" options that apply to all the subcommands. This release introduces a new `@ParentCommand` annotation that makes it easy for subcommands to access such parent command options: fields of the subcommand annotated with `@ParentCommand` are initialized with a reference to the parent command. 

This release adds support for more built-in types, so applications don't need to register custom converters for common types. The new types include Java 7 classes like `java.nio.file.Path` and Java 8 classes like the value classes in the `java.time` package. These converters are loaded using reflection and are not available when running on Java 5 or Java 6.

This release also adds a `converter` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameter` annotations. This allows a specific option or positional parameter to use a different converter than would be used by default based on the type of the field.

Furthermore, the `@Command` annotation now supports a `versionProvider` attribute. This is useful when the version of an application should be detected dynamically at runtime. For example, an implementation may return version information obtained from the JAR manifest, a properties file or some other source.

Finally, applications may now specify a custom factory for instantiating classes that were configured as annotation attributes, like subcommands, type converters and version providers.



This is the seventeenth public release.

## <a name="2.2.0-new"></a> New and noteworthy

### New `@ParentCommand` annotation 

In command line applications with subcommands, options of the top level command are often intended as "global" options that apply to all the subcommands. Prior to this release, subcommands had no easy way to access their parent command options unless the parent command made these values available in a global variable.

The `@ParentCommand` annotation makes it easy for subcommands to access their parent command options: subcommand fields annotated with `@ParentCommand` are initialized with a reference to the parent command. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "fileutils", subcommands = List.class)
class FileUtils {

    @Option(names = {"-d", "--directory"},
            description = "this option applies to all subcommands")
    File baseDirectory;
}

@Command(name = "list")
class List implements Runnable {

    @ParentCommand
    private FileUtils parent; // picocli injects reference to parent command

    @Option(names = {"-r", "--recursive"}, 
            description = "Recursively list subdirectories")
    private boolean recursive;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        list(new File(parent.baseDirectory, "."));
    }

    private void list(File dir) {
        System.out.println(dir.getAbsolutePath());
        if (dir.isDirectory()) {
            for (File f : dir.listFiles()) {
                System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath());
                if (f.isDirectory() && recursive) {
                    list(f);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### More built-in types

This release adds support for more built-in types, so applications don't need to register custom converters for common types. The new types include Java 7 classes like `java.nio.file.Path` and Java 8 classes like the value classes in the `java.time` package. These converters are loaded using reflection and are not available when running on Java 5 or Java 6.

Converters for the following types were added in this release:

* `java.nio.file.Path` (requires Java 7 or higher)
* `java.time` value objects: `Duration`, `Instant`, `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `LocalTime`, `MonthDay`, `OffsetDateTime`, `OffsetTime`, `Period`, `Year`, `YearMonth`, `ZonedDateTime`, `ZoneId`, `ZoneOffset`  (requires Java 8 or higher, invokes the `parse` method of these classes)
* `java.lang.Class` (for the fully qualified class name)
* `java.nio.ByteOrder` (for the Strings `"BIG_ENDIAN"` or `"LITTLE_ENDIAN"`)
* `java.util.Currency` (for the ISO 4217 code of the currency)
* `java.net.NetworkInterface` (for the InetAddress or name of the network interface)
* `java.util.TimeZoneConverter` (for the ID for a TimeZone)
* `java.sql.Connection` (for a database url of the form `jdbc:subprotocol:subname`)
* `java.sql.Driver` (for a database URL of the form `jdbc:subprotocol:subname`)
* `java.sql.Timestamp` (for values in the `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"` or `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fffffffff"` formats)

### Option-specific Type Converters
This release adds a `converter` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameter` annotations. This allows a specific option or positional parameter to use a different converter than would be used by default based on the type of the field.

For example, you may want to convert the constant names defined in [`java.sql.Types`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/sql/Types.html) to their `int` value for a specific field, but this should not impact any other `int` fields: other `int` fields should continue to use the default int converter that parses numeric values.

Example usage:

```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "--sqlType", converter = SqlTypeConverter.class)
    int sqlType;
}
```

Example implementation:

```java
class SqlTypeConverter implements ITypeConverter<Integer> {
    public Integer convert(String value) throws Exception {
        switch (value) {
            case "ARRAY"  : return Types.ARRAY;
            case "BIGINT" : return Types.BIGINT;
            case "BINARY" : return Types.BINARY;
            case "BIT"    : return Types.BIT;
            case "BLOB"   : return Types.BLOB;
            //...
        }
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Version Information
From this release, the `@Command` annotation supports a `versionProvider` attribute. Applications may specify a `IVersionProvider` implementation in this attribute, and picocli will instantiate this class
and invoke it to collect version information.

This is useful when the version of an application should be detected dynamically at runtime. For example, an implementation may return version information obtained from the JAR manifest, a properties file or some other source.

Custom version providers need to implement the `picocli.CommandLine.IVersionProvider` interface:

```java
public interface IVersionProvider {
    /**
     * Returns version information for a command.
     * @return version information (each string in the array is displayed on a separate line)
     * @throws Exception an exception detailing what went wrong when obtaining version information
     */
    String[] getVersion() throws Exception;
}
```

The GitHub project has a manifest file-based [example](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/picocli/examples/VersionProviderDemo2.java) and a build-generated version properties file-based [example](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/picocli/examples/VersionProviderDemo1.java) version provider implementation.

### Custom factory
Declaratively registered subcommands, type converters and version providers must be instantiated somehow. From this release, a custom factory can be specified when constructing a `CommandLine` instance. This allows full control over object creation and opens possibilities for Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. For example:

```jshelllanguage
IFactory myFactory = getCustomFactory();
CommandLine cmdLine = new CommandLine(new Git(), myFactory);

# <a name="2.1.0"></a> Picocli 2.1.0

This release contains bugfixes and new features.

Users sometimes run into system limitations on the length of a command line when creating a command line with lots of options or with long arguments for options.
Starting from this release, picocli supports "argument files" or "@-files". Argument files are files that themselves contain arguments to the command. When picocli encounters an argument beginning with the character `@', it expands the contents of that file into the argument list.

Secondly, this release adds support for multi-value boolean flags. A common use case where this is useful is to let users control the level of output verbosity by specifying more `-v` flags on the command line. For example, `-v` could give high-level output, `-vv` could show more detailed output, and `-vvv` could show debug-level information.

Finally, thanks to [aadrian](https://github.com/aadrian) and [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz), an `examples` subproject containing running examples has been added. (Your contributions are welcome!)
 
This is the sixteenth public release.

### Argument Files (`@`-files)
An argument file can include options and positional parameters in any combination. The arguments within a file can be space-separated or newline-separated. If an argument contains embedded whitespace, put the whole argument in double or single quotes (`"-f=My Files\Stuff.java"`).

Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored. The file may itself contain additional @-file arguments; any such arguments will be processed recursively.

Multiple @-files may be specified on the command line.

For example, suppose a file with arguments exists at `/home/foo/args`, with these contents:

```text
# This line is a comment and is ignored.
ABC -option=123
'X Y Z'
```

A command may be invoked with the @file argument, like this:
```bash
java MyCommand @/home/foo/args
```

The above will be expanded to the contents of the file:
```bash
java MyCommand ABC -option=123 "X Y Z"
```

This feature is similar to the 'Command Line Argument File' processing supported by gcc, javadoc and javac.
The documentation for these tools shows further examples.

### Repeated Boolean Flags

Multi-valued boolean options are now supported. For example:
```jshelllanguage
@Option(names = "-v", description = { "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.",
                                      "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`"})
boolean[] verbosity;
```

Users may specify multiple boolean flag options without parameters. For example:
```bash
<command> -v -v -v -vvv
```
The above example results in six `true` values being added to the `verbosity` array.

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

No features have been promoted in this picocli release.

## <a name="2.1.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#126] New feature: Support expanding argument files, also called `@-files`.
- [#241] New feature (enhancing [#126]): Recursively process nested @-files; allow multiple arguments per line, allow quoted arguments with embedded whitespace.
- [#217] New feature: Support repeated boolean flag options captured in multi-valued fields.
- [#223] New feature: Added `examples` subproject containing running examples.  Thanks to [aadrian](https://github.com/aadrian) and [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#68]  Enhancement: Reject private final primitive fields annotated with @Option or @Parameters: because compile-time constants are inlined, updates by picocli to such fields would not be visible to the application.
- [#239] Enhancement: Improve error message when Exception thrown from Runnable/Callable.
- [#240] Bugfix: RunAll handler should return empty list, not null, when help is requested.
- [#244] Bugfix: the parser only considered `help` options instead of any of `help`, `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` to determine if missing required options can be ignored when encountering a subcommand. Thanks to [mkavanagh](https://github.com/mkavanagh).

## <a name="2.1.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations

The `Range::defaultArity(Class)` method is now deprecated in favour of the `Range::defaultArity(Field)` method introduced in v2.0.

## <a name="2.1.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

Private final fields that are either `String` or primitive types can no longer be annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`.
Picocli will throw an `InitializationException` when it detects such fields,
because compile-time constants are inlined, and updates by picocli to such fields would not be visible to the application.



# <a name="2.0.3"></a> Picocli 2.0.3

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.3.

This is a bugfix release that fixes a parser bug where the first argument following a clustered options was treated as a positional parameter, and removes the erroneous runtime dependency on `groovy-lang` that slipped in with the 2.0 release.

This release also includes a minor enhancement to support embedded newlines in usage help sections like header or descriptions. This allows Groovy applications to use [triple-quoted](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_triple_double_quoted_string) and [dollar slashy](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_dollar_slashy_string) multi-line strings in usage help sections.

This is the fifteenth public release.

# <a name="2.0"></a> Picocli 2.0

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.

First, picocli now provides tight integration for Groovy scripts.
The new `@picocli.groovy.PicocliScript` annotation allows Groovy scripts to use the `@Command` annotation,
and turns a Groovy script into a picocli-based command line application.
When the script is run, `@Field` variables annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`
are initialized from the command line arguments before the script body is executed.

Applications with subcommands will also benefit from upgrading to picocli 2.0.
The `CommandLine.run` and `CommandLine.call` methods now work for subcommands,
and if more flexibility is needed, take a look at the new `parseWithHandler` methods.
Error handling for subcommands has been improved in this release with the new `ParseException.getCommandLine` method.

Improved ease of use: Usage help is now printed automatically from the `CommandLine.run` and `CommandLine.call` methods
and from the built-in handlers used with the `parseWithHandler` method.

The parser has been improved and users can now mix positional arguments with options on the command line.
Previously, positional parameter had to follow the options.
**Important notice:** To make this feature possible, the default parsing behaviour of multi-value options and parameters changed to be non-greedy by default.

Finally, this release includes many [bug fixes](#2.0-fixes).

This is the twelfth public release.

## <a name="2.0-new"></a> New and noteworthy

### <a name="2.0-groovy-script"></a> Groovy Script Support
Picocli 2.0 introduces special support for Groovy scripts.

Scripts annotated with `@picocli.groovy.PicocliScript` are automatically transformed to use
`picocli.groovy.PicocliBaseScript` as their base class and can also use the `@Command` annotation to
customize parts of the usage message like command name, description, headers, footers etc.

Before the script body is executed, the `PicocliBaseScript` base class parses the command line and initializes
`@Field` variables annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`.
The script body is executed if the user input was valid and did not request usage help or version information.

```groovy
// exampleScript.groovy
@Grab('info.picocli:picocli:2.0.0')
@Command(name = "myCommand", description = "does something special")
@PicocliScript
import picocli.groovy.PicocliScript
import picocli.CommandLine.Command
import picocli.CommandLine.Option
import groovy.transform.Field

@Option(names = "-x", description = "number of repetitions")
@Field int count;

@Option(names = ["-h", "--help"], usageHelp = true, description = "print this help message and exit")
@Field boolean helpRequested;

//if (helpRequested) { // not necessary: PicocliBaseScript takes care of this
//    CommandLine.usage(this, System.err); return 0;
//}
count.times {
   println "hi"
}
// the CommandLine that parsed the args is available as a property
assert this.commandLine.commandName == "myCommand"
```

### <a name="2.0-subcommands"></a> Better Subcommand Support
New methods `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` were added. These methods intend to offer the same ease of use as 
the `run` and `call` methods, but with more flexibility and better support for nested subcommands.

The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand 
specified by the user. (Previously subcommands were ignored and only the top-level command was executed.)

From this release, picocli exceptions provide a `getCommandLine` method 
that returns the command or subcommand where parsing or execution failed.
Previously, if the user provided invalid input for applications with subcommands,
it was difficult to pinpoint exactly which subcommand failed to parse the input.

### <a name="2.0-ease-of-use"></a> Easier To Use
The convenience methods will automatically print usage help and version information
when the user specifies options annotated with the `versionHelp` or `usageHelp` attributes.

Methods that automatically print help:

* CommandLine::call
* CommandLine::run
* CommandLine::parseWithHandler (with the built-in Run…​ handlers)
* CommandLine::parseWithHandlers (with the built-in Run…​ handlers)

Methods that do not automatically print help:

* CommandLine::parse
* CommandLine::populateCommand

Also notable: Collection and Map fields no longer require the `type` annotation attribute: 
picocli now infers the conversion target type from the generic type parameters where possible.

### <a name="2.0-parser-improvements"></a> Parser Improvements 
Positional parameters can now be mixed with options on the command line. Previously, positional parameter had to follow the options.

To make this feature possible, the default parsing behaviour of multi-value options and parameters changed to be non-greedy by default.

### <a name="2.0-help-improvements"></a> Usage Help Format Improvements
This release contains various bugfixes related to improving the usage help format for multi-value options and collections.
For example, for Maps that don't have a `paramLabel`, picocli now shows key type and value type instead of the internal Java field name.

## <a name="2.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

The following are the features that have been promoted in this picocli release.

* Autocomplete - as of picocli 2.0, autocompletion is no longer beta.

## <a name="2.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#207] API Change: Provide ability to find which subcommand threw a ParameterException API enhancement. Thanks to [velit](https://github.com/velit) and [AshwinJay](https://github.com/AshwinJay).
- [#179] API Change to remove full JRE dependency and require only Compact Profile. Replace use of `java.awt.Point` with `picocli.CommandLine.Help.TextTable.Cell`. Thanks to [webfolderio](https://github.com/webfolderio).
- [#205] API Change: `CommandLine::getCommand` now returns a generic type instead of Object so client code can avoid type casting.
- [#196] API Change: `Option::type()` and `Parameters::type()` now return empty array by default (was `{String.class}`).
- [#210] API Change: Deprecated the option `help` attribute in favour of the `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` attributes.
- [#115] New feature: Added new `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` convenience methods for commands with subcommands.
- [#130] New feature: Options and positional parameters can now be mixed on the command line.
- [#196] New feature: Infer type from collections and maps when `type` annotation not specified. Thanks to [ddimtirov](https://github.com/ddimtirov) for the suggestion.
- [#197] New feature: Use `type` attribute to determine conversion target type instead of field type. This allows fields to be declared as interfaces or abstract types (or arrays/collections/maps of these) and via the `type` attribute picocli will be able to convert String arguments to concrete implementation objects.
- [#187] New feature: Added methods to programmatically get and set the command name.
- [#192] Bugfix: Default arity should be 1, not *, for array and collection options. Thanks to [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#193] Bugfix: Splitting an argument should not cause max arity to be exceeded.
- [#191] Bugfix: Arity should not limit the total number of values put in an array or collection. Thanks to [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#186] Bugfix: Confusing usage message for collection options. Thanks to [AlexFalappa](https://github.com/AlexFalappa).
- [#181] Bugfix: Incorrect help message was displayed for short options with paramLabel when arity > 1.
- [#184] Bugfix/Enhancement: Programmatically setting the separator is now reflected in the usage help message. Thanks to [defnull](https://github.com/defnull).
- [#200] Bugfix: Prevent NPE when command name is set to empty string or spaces. Thanks to [jansohn](https://github.com/jansohn).
- [#203] Bugfix: Empty string parameter parsed incorrectly. Thanks to [AshwinJay](https://github.com/AshwinJay).
- [#194] Enhancement: Usage help should show split regex for option/parameters.
- [#198] Enhancement: Usage help parameter list details should indicate arity for positional parameters.
- [#195] Enhancement: Usage help should show Map types if paramLabel not specified.
- [#183] Enhancement: Add examples to user manual for using picocli in other JVM languages. Thanks to [binkley](https://github.com/binkley) for pointing out that Kotlin may support array literals in annotations from 1.2.
- [#185] Enhancement: Exception message text for missing options should not use field names but be more descriptive and consistent with usage help. Thanks to [AlexFalappa](https://github.com/AlexFalappa).
- [#201] Enhancement: Usage help should not show `null` default values. Thanks to [jansohn](https://github.com/jansohn).
- [#202] Enhancement: Java 9: add `Automatic-Module-Name: info.picocli` to MANIFEST.MF to make picocli play nice in the Java 9 module system.
- [#204] Enhancement: instantiate `LinkedHashSet` instead of `HashSet` for `Set` fields to preserve input ordering.
- [#208] Enhancement: Remove pom.xml, which was not being maintained. Picocli can only be built with gradle going forward.
- [#212] Enhancement: Improve javadoc for picocli.AutoComplete.

## <a name="2.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations
The `help` attribute for options is now deprecated. Please change to use `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` attributes instead.
From picocli v2.0, the convenience methods will automatically print usage help and version information
when requested with the `versionHelp` and `usageHelp` option attributes (but not for the `help` attribute).


## <a name="2.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

This release has a number of incompatible changes:
* Multi-value options (array, list and map fields) are **not greedy by default** any more.
* **Arity is not max values**: end users may specify multi-value options (array, list and map fields) an unlimited number of times.
* A single argument that is split into parts with a regex now **counts as a single argument** (so `arity="1"` won't prevent all parts from being added to the field)
* API change: replaced `java.awt.Point` with custom `Cell` class as return value type for public method `Help.TextTable.putValue()`.
* API change: `@Option.type()` and `@Parameters.type()` now return an empty array by default (was `{String.class}`).
* API change: `ParameterException` and all subclasses now require a `CommandLine` object indicating the command or subcommand that the user provided invalid input for.
* The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand specified by the user. Previously subcommands were ignored and the top-level command was executed unconditionally.

I am not happy about the disruption these changes may cause, but I felt they were needed for three reasons:
the old picocli v1.0 behaviour caused ambiguity in common use cases,
was inconsistent with most Unix tools, 
and prevented supporting mixing options with positional arguments on the command line.

To illustrate the new non-greedy behaviour, consider this example program:
```java
class MixDemo {
  @Option(names="-o") List<String> options;
  @Parameters         List<String> positionalParams;

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("positional: " + positionalParams);
    System.out.println("options   : " + options);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CommandLine.run(new MixDemo(), System.err, args);
  }
}
```
We run this program as below, where the option is followed by multiple values:

```bash
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3
```

Previously, the arguments following `-o` would all end up in the `options` list. Running the above command with picocli 1.0 would print out the following:

```bash
# (Previously, in picocli-1.0.1)
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3

positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
```

From picocli 2.0, only the first argument following `-o` is added to the `options` list, the remainder is parsed as positional parameters:

```bash
# (Currently, in picocli-2.0)
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3

positional: [2, 3]
options   : [1]
```

To put multiple values in the options list in picocli 2.0, users can specify the `-o` option multiple times:
```bash
$ java MixDemo -o 1 -o 2 -o 3

positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
```

Alternatively, application authors can make a multi-value option greedy in picocli v2.0 by explicitly setting a variable arity:
```java
class Args {
    @Option(names = "-o", arity = "1..*") List<String> options;
}
```
(... "greedy" means consume until the next option, so not necessarily all remaining command line arguments.)

Non-breaking changes to support Callable commands, Map options and format specifiers in version help.

This is the tenth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="1.0.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

* [#121] New feature: command line autocompletion. Picocli can generate bash and zsh completion scripts that allow the shell to generate potential completion matches based on the `@Option` and `@Command` annotations in your application. After this script is installed, the shell will show the options and subcommands available in your java command line application, and in some cases show possible option values.
* [#67] New feature: Map options like `-Dkey1=val1 -Dkey2=val2`. Both key and value can be strongly typed (not just Strings).
* [#158] New feature: parser TRACING for easy troubleshooting. The trace level can be controlled with a system property.
* [#170] New feature: added `call` convenience method similar to `run`. Applications whose main business logic may throw an exception or returns a result can now implement `Callable` and reduce some boilerplate code.
* [#149] Parser now throws UnmatchedArgumentException for args that resemble options but are not, instead of treating like them positional parameters. Thanks to [giaco777](https://github.com/giaco777).
* [#172] Parser now throws MaxValuesforFieldExceededException when multi-valued option or parameters max arity exceeded
* [#173] Parser now throws UnmatchedArgumentException when not all positional parameters are assigned to a field
* [#171] WARN when option overwritten with different value (when isOverwrittenOptionsAllowed=true); WARN for unmatched args (when isUnmatchedArgumentsAllowed=true). Thanks to [ddimtirov](https://github.com/ddimtirov).
* [#164] API change: Support format patterns in version string and printVersionHelp
* [#167] API change: Change `type` attribute from `Class` to `Class[]`. This was needed for Map options support.
* [#168] API change: `CommandLine::setSeparator` method now returns this CommandLine (was void), allowing for chained method calls.
* [#156] Added example to user manual to clarify main command common usage. Thanks to [nagkumar](https://github.com/nagkumar).
* [#166] Fixed bug where adjacent markup sections resulted in incorrect ANSI escape sequences
* [#174] Fixed bug where under some circumstances, unmatched parameters were added to UnmatchedParameters list twice

# <a name="0.9.7"></a> 0.9.7 - Bugfix and enhancements release for public review. API may change.

## <a name="0.9.7-summary"></a> Summary

Version 0.9.7 has some breaking API changes.

**Better Groovy support**

It was [pointed out](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/135) that Groovy had trouble distinguishing between
the static `parse(Object, String...)` method and the instance method `parse(String...)`.

To address this, the static `parse(Object, String...)` method has been renamed
to `populateCommand(Object, String...)` in  version 0.9.7.

**Nested subcommands**

* Version 0.9.7 adds support for [nested sub-subcommands](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/127)
* `CommandLine::parse` now returns `List<CommandLine>` (was `List<Object>`)
* `CommandLine::getCommands` now returns `Map<String, CommandLine>` (was `Map<String, Object>`)
* renamed method `CommandLine::addCommand` to `addSubcommand`
* renamed method `CommandLine::getCommands` to `getSubcommands`

**Miscellaneous**

Renamed class `Arity` to `Range` since it is not just used for @Option and @Parameters `arity` but also for `index` in positional @Parameters.
