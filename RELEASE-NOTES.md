# picocli Release Notes

# <a name="4.4.0"></a> Picocli 4.4.0 (UNRELEASED)
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.4.0.

This release contains bugfixes and enhancements.

From this release, picocli supports abbreviated options and subcommands. When abbreviations are enabled, users can specify the initial letter(s) of the first component and optionally of one or more subsequent components of an option or subcommand name.
"Components" are separated by `-` dash characters or by case, so for example, both `--CamelCase` and `--kebab-case` have two components.

Fixed a bug in argument group parsing where incorrect input with missing mandatory elements was accepted when an option was specified multiple times.

This is the seventy-first public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### <a name="4.4.0-abbreviated-options-and-commands"></a> Abbreviated Options and Subcommands

Since picocli 4.4, the parser can recognize abbreviated options and subcommands.
This needs to be enabled explicitly with `CommandLine::setAbbreviatedOptionsAllowed` and `CommandLine::setAbbreviatedSubcommandsAllowed`.

#### Recognized Abbreviations
When abbreviations are enabled, users can specify the initial letter(s) of the first component and optionally of one or more subsequent components of an option or subcommand name.

"Components" are separated by `-` dash characters or by case, so for example, both `--CamelCase` and `--kebab-case` have two components.

NOTE: When case sensitivity is disabled, only the `-` dash character can be used to separate components.

Examples of valid abbreviations:

```
Option or Subcommand | Recognized Abbreviations
-------------------- | ------------------------
--veryLongCamelCase  | --very, --vLCC  --vCase
--super-long-option  | --sup, --sLO, --s-l-o, --s-lon, --s-opt, --sOpt
some-long-command    | so, sLC, s-l-c, soLoCo, someCom
```

#### Ambiguous Abbreviations
When the user specifies input that can match multiple options or subcommands, the parser throws a `ParameterException`.
When applications use the `execute` method, a short error message and the usage help is displayed to the user.

For example, given a command with subcommands `help` and `hello`, then ambiguous user input like `hel` will show this error message:

```
Error: 'hel' is not unique: it matches 'hello', 'help'
```

#### Abbreviated Long Options and POSIX Clustered Short Options

When an argument can match both a long option and a set of clustered short options, picocli matches the long option.

For example:

```java
class AbbreviationsAndPosix {
    @Option(names = "-A") boolean a;
    @Option(names = "-B") boolean b;
    @Option(names = "-AaaBbb") boolean aaaBbb;
}
AbbreviationsAndPosix app = new AbbreviationsAndPosix();
new CommandLine(app).setAbbreviatedOptionsAllowed(true).parseArgs("-AB");
assertTrue(app.aaaBbb);
assertFalse(app.a);
assertFalse(app.b);
```

When abbreviated options are enabled, user input `-AB` will match the long `-AaaBbb` option, but not the `-A` and `-B` options.

# <a name="4.3.0"></a> Picocli 4.3.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.3.0.

This is a fairly big release with 70 [tickets closed](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/milestone/65?closed=1), and over 50 [bugfixes and enhancements](#4.3.0-fixes). Many thanks to the picocli community who contributed 21 pull requests!

A major theme of this release is sharing options between commands:
* New feature: "inherited" options. Options defined with `scope = ScopeType.INHERIT` are shared with all subcommands (and sub-subcommands, to any level of depth). Applications can define an inherited option on the top-level command, in one place, to allow end users to specify this option anywhere: not only on the top-level command, but also on any of the subcommands and nested sub-subcommands.
* More powerful mixins. Mixin classes can declare a `@Spec(MIXEE)`-annotated field, and picocli will inject the `CommandSpec` of the command _receiving_ this mixin (the "mixee") into this field. This is useful for mixins containing shared logic, in addition to shared options and parameters. 

Another major theme is improved support for positional parameters:
* Automatic indexes for positional parameters. Single-value positional parameters without an explicit `index = "..."` attribute are now automatically assigned an index based on the other positional parameters in the command. One use case is mixins with positional parameters.
* Repeatable ArgGroups can now define positional parameters.

Other improvements:
* The parser now supports case-insensitive mode for options and subcommands.
* Error handlers now use ANSI colors and styles. The default styles are bold red for the error message, and italic for stack traces. Applications can customize with the new `Help.ColorScheme` methods `errors` and `stackTraces`.
* The usage help message can now show an entry for `--` in the options list with the `@Command(showEndOfOptionsDelimiterInUsageHelp = true)` annotation.
* Easily make subcommands mandatory by making the top-level command a class that does not implement `Runnable` or `Callable`.

 
This is the sixty-eighth public release.

## <a name="4.3.0-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
### <a name="4.3.0-inherited-options"></a> Inherited Options

This release adds support for "inherited" options. Options defined with `scope = ScopeType.INHERIT` are shared with all subcommands (and sub-subcommands, to any level of depth). Applications can define an inherited option on the top-level command, in one place, to allow end users to specify this option anywhere: not only on the top-level command, but also on any of the subcommands and nested sub-subcommands.

Below is an example where an inherited option is used to configure logging.

```java
@Command(name = "app", subcommands = Sub.class)
class App implements Runnable {
    private static Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(App.class);

    @Option(names = "-x", scope = ScopeType.LOCAL) // option is not shared: this is the default
    int x;
    
    @Option(names = "-v", scope = ScopeType.INHERIT) // option is shared with subcommands, sub-subcommands, etc
    public void setVerbose(boolean verbose) {
        // Configure log4j.
        // This is a simplistic example: you probably only want to modify the ConsoleAppender level.
        Configurator.setRootLevel(verbose ? Level.DEBUG : Level.INFO);
    }
    
    public void run() {
        logger.debug("-x={}", x);
    }
}

@Command(name = "sub")
class Sub implements Runnable {
    private static Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(Sub.class);

    @Option(names = "-y")
    int y;
    
    public void run() {
        logger.debug("-y={}", y);
    }
}
```

Users can specify the `-v` option on either the top-level command or on the subcommand, and it will have the same effect.

```
# the -v option can be specified on the top-level command
java App -x=3 -v sub -y=4
```

Specifying the `-v` option on the subcommand will have the same effect. For example: 
```
# specifying the -v option on the subcommand also changes the log level
java App -x=3 sub -y=4 -v
```

NOTE: Subcommands don't need to do anything to receive inherited options, but a potential drawback is that subcommands do not get a reference to inherited options.

Subcommands that need to inspect the value of an inherited option can use the `@ParentCommand` annotation to get a reference to their parent command, and access the inherited option via the parent reference.
Alternatively, for such subcommands, sharing options via mixins may be a more suitable mechanism.

### <a name="4.3.0-case-insensitive"></a> Case-insensitive mode
By default, all options and subcommands are case sensitive. Case sensitivity can be switched off globally, as well as on a per-command basis.

To toggle case sensitivity for all commands, use the `CommandLine::setSubcommandsCaseInsensitive` and `CommandLine::setOptionsCaseInsensitive` methods. Use the `CommandSpec::subcommandsCaseInsensitive` and `CommandSpec::optionsCaseInsensitive` methods to give some commands a different case sensitivity than others.


### <a name="4.3.0-auto-index"></a> Automatic Indexes for Positional Parameters

From this release, when the `index = "..."` attribute is omitted, the default index is `index = "0+"`, which tells picocli to assign an index automatically, starting from zero, based on the other positional parameters defined in the same command.

A simple example can look like this:

```java
class AutomaticIndex {
    @Parameters(hidden = true)  // "hidden": don't show this parameter in usage help message
    List<String> allParameters; // no "index" attribute: captures _all_ arguments

    @Parameters String group;    // assigned index = "0"
    @Parameters String artifact; // assigned index = "1"
    @Parameters String version;  // assigned index = "2"
}
```

Picocli initializes fields with the values at the specified index in the arguments array.

```java
String[] args = { "info.picocli", "picocli", "4.3.0" };
AutomaticIndex auto = CommandLine.populateCommand(new AutomaticIndex(), args);

assert auto.group.equals("info.picocli");
assert auto.artifact.equals("picocli");
assert auto.version.equals("4.3.0");
assert auto.allParameters.equals(Arrays.asList(args));
```

The default automatic index (`index = "0+"`) for single-value positional parameters is "anchored at zero": it starts at zero, and is increased with each additional positional parameter.

Sometimes you want to have indexes assigned automatically from a different starting point than zero. This can be useful when defining Mixins with positional parameters.

To accomplish this, specify an index with the anchor point and a `+` character to indicate that picocli should start to automatically assign indexes from that anchor point. For example:

```java
class Anchored {
    @Parameters(index = "1+") String p1; // assigned index = "1" or higher
    @Parameters(index = "1+") String p2; // assigned index = "2" or higher
}
```

Finally, sometimes you want to have indexes assigned automatically to come at the end. Again, this can be useful when defining Mixins with positional parameters.

To accomplish this, specify an index with a `+` character to indicate that picocli should automatically assign indexes that come at the end. For example:

```java
class Unanchored {
    @Parameters(index = "+") String penultimate; // assigned the penultimate index in the command
    @Parameters(index = "+") String last;        // assigned the last index in the command
}
```

### <a name="4.3.0-positionals-in-groups"></a>  Repeatable ArgGroups with Positional Parameters

From this release, positional parameters can be used in repeating [Argument Groups](https://picocli.info/#_argument_groups).

When a `@Parameters` positional parameter is part of a group, its `index` is the index _within the group_, not within the command.

Below is an example of an application that uses a repeating group of positional parameters:

```java
@Command(name = "grades", mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "grades 1.0")
public class Grades implements Runnable {

    static class StudentGrade {
        @Parameters(index = "0") String name;
        @Parameters(index = "1") BigDecimal grade;
    }

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = false, multiplicity = "1..*")
    List<StudentGrade> gradeList;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        gradeList.forEach(e -> System.out.println(e.name + ": " + e.grade));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.exit(new CommandLine(new Grades()).execute(args));
    }
}
```

Running the above program with this input:

```
Alice 3.1 Betty 4.0 "X Æ A-12" 3.5 Zaphod 3.4
```
Produces the following output:

```
Alice: 3.1
Betty: 4.0
X Æ A-12: 3.5
Zaphod: 3.4
```

### <a name="4.3.0-mixee"></a>  `@Spec(MIXEE)` Annotation
From this release, mixins are more powerful. Mixin classes can declare a `@Spec(MIXEE)`-annotated field, and picocli will inject the `CommandSpec` of the command _receiving_ this mixin (the "mixee") into this field. This is useful for mixins containing shared logic, in addition to shared options and parameters. 

Since picocli 4.3, the `@Spec` annotation has a `value` element.
The value is `Spec.Target.SELF` by default, meaning that the `CommandSpec` of the enclosing class is injected into the `@Spec`-annotated field.

For classes that are used as a [mixins](https://picocli.info/#_mixins), there is another value that may be useful.
When `@Spec(Spec.Target.MIXEE)` is specified in a mixin class, the `CommandSpec` of the command _receiving_ this mixin (the "mixee") is injected into the `@Spec`-annotated field.
This can be useful when a mixin contains logic that is common to many commands. For example:

```java
import picocli.CommandLine.Option;
import picocli.CommandLine.Spec;

class AdvancedMixin {
    @Spec(Spec.Target.MIXEE) CommandSpec mixee;

    /**
     * When the -x option is specified on any subcommand,
     * multiply its value with another integer supplied by this subcommand
     * and set the result on the top-level command.
     * @param x the value of the -x option
     */
    @Option(names = "-x")
    void setValue(int x) {
        // Get another value from the command we are mixed into.
        // This mixin requires the command(s) it is mixed into to implement `IntSupplier`.
        int y = ((java.util.function.IntSupplier) mixee.userObject()).getAsInt();

        int product = x * y;

        // Set the result on the top-level (root) command.
        // This mixin requires the root command to implement `IntConsumer`.
        ((java.util.function.IntConsumer) mixee.root().userObject()).accept(product);
    }
}
```

### <a name="4.3.0-end-of-options"></a> Showing `--` End of Options in usage help
From picocli 4.3, an entry for the `--` End of Options delimiter can be shown in the options list of the usage help message of a command with the `@Command(showEndOfOptionsDelimiterInUsageHelp = true)` annotation.

Example command:

```java
@Command(name = "myapp", showEndOfOptionsDelimiterInUsageHelp = true,
        mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, description = "Example command.")
class MyApp {
    @Parameters(description = "A file.") File file;
}
```

The usage help message for this command looks like this:

```
Usage: myapp [-hV] [--] <file>
Example command.
      <file>      A file.
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
  --              This option can be used to separate command-line options from
                    the list of positional parameters.
```

## <a name="4.3.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations
No features were deprecated in this release.

## <a name="4.3.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

Behaviour has changed for some cases involving positional parameters.
One example is applications that define multiple positional parameters without an explicit `index` (see next section).
I hope these are edge cases.
Other than that, some error messages and details of the usage help message have changed.
See details below.

### Default index for single-value positional parameters

Prior to picocli 4.3.0, if your application defines any single-value positional parameters without explicit `index`, these parameters would all point to index zero.
From picocli 4.3.0, picocli automatically assigns an index, so the first such parameter gets index `0` (zero), the next parameter gets index `1` (one), the next parameter gets index `2` (two), etc.

This may break applications that have multiple single-value positional parameters without explicit `index`, that expect to capture the first argument in all of these parameters.

### Different error when user specifies too many parameters

The error message has changed when a user specifies more positional parameters than the program can accept. For example:

```java
class SingleValue {
    @Parameters String str;
}
```

This program only accepts one parameter. What happens when this program is invoked incorrectly with two parameters, like this:

```java
java SingleValue val1 val2
```

Before this release, picocli would throw an `OverwrittenOptionException` with message `"positional parameter at index 0..* (<str>) should be specified only once"`.

From picocli 4.3, picocli throws an `UnmatchedArgumentException` with message `"Unmatched argument at index 1: 'val2'"`.

This may break applications that have error handling that depends on an `OverwrittenOptionException` being thrown.

### Different mechanism for dealing with too many parameters

Continuing with the previous example, before this release, applications could deal with this by allowing single-value options to be overwritten:

```java
// before
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new SingleValue());
cmd.setOverwrittenOptionsAllowed(true);
// ...
```

From picocli 4.3, applications need to allow unmatched arguments instead:

```java
// after
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new SingleValue());
cmd.setUnmatchedArgumentsAllowed(true);
// ...
// get the invalid values
cmd.getUnmatchedArguments();
```

### Usage help message for single-value positional parameters
Before picocli 4.3.0, single-value positional parameters would incorrectly show an ellipsis (`...`) after their parameter label. This ellipsis is incorrect because it indicates that multiple values can be specified. The ellipsis is no longer shown for single-value positional parameters from picocli 4.3.0.

Before:

```
Usage: <main class> PARAM...
      PARAM...   Param description.
```

After:

```
Usage: <main class> PARAM
      PARAM   Param description.
```

This may break application tests that expect a specific usage help message format.

### Different error for missing required options or parameters

#### Missing options list now starts with colon, no more square brackets
Before:

```
Missing required option '--required=<required>'
Missing required options [-a=<first>, -b=<second>, -c=<third>]
```

After:

```
Missing required option: '--required=<required>'
Missing required options: '-a=<first>', '-b=<second>', '-c=<third>'
```

#### Better message when both options and positional parameters are missing
Before:

```
Missing required options [-x=<x>, params[0]=<p0>, params[1]=<p1>]
```

After:

```
Missing required options and parameters: '-x=<x>', '<p0>', '<p1>'
```

#### Missing positional parameters are now quoted
Before:

```
Missing required parameter: <mandatory>
Missing required parameters: <mandatory>, <anotherMandatory>
```

After:

```
Missing required parameter: '<mandatory>'
Missing required parameters: '<mandatory>', '<anotherMandatory>'
```


# <a name="4.2.0"></a> Picocli 4.2.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.2.0.

This release adds support for Repeatable Subcommands: when a command is marked as `@Command(subcommandsRepeatable = true)` it becomes possible to specify that command's subcommands multiple times on the command line.

The `picocli-codegen` module can now generate AsciiDoc documentation for picocli-based applications. AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language that can easily can be converted to unix man pages, HTML and PDF with the wonderful [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#man-pages) tool.

From this release, subcommands are not instantiated until they are matched on the command line. This should improve the startup time for applications with subcommands that do a lot of initialization when they are instantiated.

Autocompletion improvements: from this release the generated bash completions scripts support completing positional parameters, and are implemented without the use of associative arrays (so they should work on MacOS or other systems that use older versions of bash).
Additionally there are now automated tests using Expect to verify that the generated completion scripts work as expected.

GraalVM configuration generation improvement: added `--factory` option to `ReflectionConfigGenerator`, `ResourceConfigGenerator` and `DynamicProxyConfigGenerator`.
This makes it possible to generate configurations for command classes without a default no-arg constructor.

From this release it is possible to inject the `CommandSpec` into a `IVersionProvider`, making it easier to write version provider implementations that are reusable across multiple commands or even applications.

Similarly, from this release it is possible to inject the parent command object into mixins via a `@ParentCommand`-annotated field.

This release adds programmatic API to allow the long options column to grow larger than 20 characters in the usage help message via the `CommandLine::setLongOptionsMaxWidth` and `UsageMessageSpec::longOptionsMaxWidth` methods.


Finally, it is now possible let the usage help show that [@-files](https://picocli.info/#AtFiles) are supported by listing a `@<filename>` entry above the list of positional parameters in the usage help.

This is the sixty-seventh public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="4.2.0-new"></a> New and Noteworthy

### <a name="4.2.0-generate-docs"></a> Generate AsciiDoc Documentation for Your Application (convertable to unix man pages, HTML and PDF)
This release adds a new class `picocli.codegen.docgen.manpage.ManPageGenerator` to the `picocli-codegen` module that generates AsciiDoc documentation for picocli-based applications using the `manpage` doctype and manpage document structure.
The generated AsciiDoc files can be converted to HTML, PDF and unix man pages with the [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#man-pages) tool.

The [`picocli-codegen` README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/picocli-codegen/README.adoc) has more details.

### <a name="4.2.0-repeatable-subcommands"></a> Repeatable Subcommands
From picocli 4.2, it is possible to specify that a command's subcommands can be specified multiple times by marking it with `@Command(subcommandsRepeatable = true)`.

#### Example
Below is an example where the top-level command `myapp` is marked as `subcommandsRepeatable = true`.
This command has three subcommands, `add`, `list` and `send-report`:

```java
@Command(name = "myapp", subcommandsRepeatable = true)
class MyApp implements Runnable {

    @Command
    void add(@Option(names = "-x") String x, @Option(names = "-w") double w) { ... }

    @Command
    void list(@Option(names = "--where") String where) { ... }

    @Command(name = "send-report")
    void sendReport(@Option(names = "--to", split = ",") String[] recipients) { ... }

    // ...
}
```

The above example command allows users to specify one or more of its subcommands multiple time. For example, this would be a valid invocation:

```bash
myapp add -x=item1 -w=0.2 \
      add -x=item2 -w=0.5 \
      add -x=item3 -w=0.7 \
      list --where "w>0.2" \
      send-report --to=recipient@myorg.com
```

In the above command line invocation, the `myapp` top-level command is followed by its subcommand `add`.
Next, this is followed by another two occurences of `add`, followed by `list` and `send-report`.
These are all "sibling" commands, that share the same parent command `myapp`.
This invocation is valid because `myapp` is marked with `subcommandsRepeatable = true`.

#### Repeatable Subcommands Specification

Normally, `subcommandsRepeatable` is `false`, so for each command, only one of its subcommands can be specified, potentially followed by only one sub-subcommand of that subcommand, etc.
In mathematical terms, a valid sequence of commands and subcommands can be represented by a _directed rooted tree_ that starts at the top-level command. This is illustrated by the diagram below.

![subcommands not repeatable](https://picocli.info/images/subcommands-non-repeatable.png)

When `subcommandsRepeatable` is set to `true` on a command, the subcommands of this command may appear multiple times.
Also, a subcommand can be followed by a "sibling" command (another command with the same parent command).

In mathematical terms, when a parent command has this property, the additional valid sequences of its subcommands form a fully connected subgraph (_a complete digraph_).

The blue and green dotted arrows in the diagram below illustrate the additional sequences that are allowed when a command has repeatable subcommands.

![subcommands-repeatable](https://picocli.info/images/subcommands-repeatable2.png)


Note that it is not valid to specify a subcommand followed by its parent command:

```bash
# invalid: cannot move _up_ the hierarchy
myapp add -x=item1 -w=0.2 myapp
```

### <a name="4.2.0-lazy-instantiation"></a> Subcommands are now lazily instantiated

From this release,  subcommands are not instantiated until they are matched on the command line,
unless the user object has a `@Spec` or `@ParentObject`-annotated field; these are instantiated during initialization.


### <a name="4.2.0-versionprovider-with-spec"></a> Injecting `CommandSpec` Into a `IVersionProvider`

From this release, `IVersionProvider` implementations can have `@Spec`-annotated fields. If such a field
exists, picocli will inject the `CommandSpec` of the command that uses this version provider.
This gives the version provider access to the full command hierarchy,
and may make it easier to implement version providers that can be reused among multiple commands.

For example:

```java
class MyVersionProvider implements IVersionProvider {
    @Spec CommandSpec spec;

    public String[] getVersion() {
        return new String[] { "Version info for " + spec.qualifiedName() };
    }
}
```

### <a name="4.2.0-atfiles-usage"></a> Showing `@filename` in usage help

From picocli 4.2, an entry for `@<filename>` can be shown in the options and parameters list of the usage help message of a command with the `@Command(showAtFileInUsageHelp = true)` annotation.

Example:

```java
@Command(name = "myapp", showAtFileInUsageHelp = true,
        mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, description = "Example command.")
class MyApp {
    @Parameters(description = "A file.") File file;
}
```

The usage help message for this command looks like this:

```
Usage: myapp [-hV] [@<filename>...] <file>
Example command.
      [@<filename>...]   One or more argument files containing options.
      <file>             A file.
  -h, --help             Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version          Print version information and exit.
```

By default, the `@<filename>` entry is shown before the positional parameters in the synopsis as well as in the parameters list.
This can be changed with the Help API for [reordering sections](https://picocli.info/#_reordering_sections). 

Both the label and the description of the `@<filename>` entry have been defined with [custom variables](https://picocli.info/#_custom_variables), to allow applications to change the text. The variables are:

* `picocli.atfile.label`
* `picocli.atfile.description`

By setting the above variables in either system properties, environment variables or the [resource bundle](https://picocli.info/#_internationalization) for a command, the text can be customized.

See the [user manual](https://picocli.info/#_show_at_files) for examples.

### <a name="4.2.0-mixins"></a> Mixins with `@ParentCommand`-annotated fields

A common use case is sharing options between different levels of the command hierarchy, so that "global" options from the top-level command are also available on subcommands.

Since picocli 4.2, [`@ParentCommand`-annotated](https://picocli.info/#_parentcommand_annotation) fields can be used in mixins, which makes this easier. See the [Use Case: Sharing Options](https://picocli.info/#_use_case_sharing_options) section of the user manual for a full example.

For mixins that need to be reusable across more than two levels in the command hierarchy, injecting a [`@Spec`-annotated](https://picocli.info/#_spec_annotation) field gives the mixin access to the full command hierarchy.

### <a name="4.2.0-long-options-width"></a> Configurable long options column width

The default layout shows short options and long options in separate columns, followed by the description column.
The width of the long options column shrinks automatically if all long options are very short,
but by default this column does not grow larger than 20 characters.

If the long option with its option parameter is longer than 20 characters
(for example: `--output=<outputFolder>`), the long option overflows into the description column, and the option description is shown on the next line.

This (the default) looks like this:

```
Usage: myapp [-hV] [-o=<outputFolder>]
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output=<outputFolder>
                  Output location full path.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
```

From picocli 4.2, there is programmatic API to change this via the `CommandLine::setLongOptionsMaxWidth` and `UsageMessageSpec::longOptionsMaxWidth` methods.

In the above example, if we call `commandLine.setLongOptionsMaxWidth(23)` before printing the usage help, we get this result:

```
Usage: myapp [-hV] [-o=<outputFolder>]
  -h, --help                    Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output=<outputFolder>   Output location full path.
  -V, --version                 Print version information and exit.
```

## <a name="4.2.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues
* [#454] API: Added support for repeatable subcommands. Thanks to [Idan Arye](https://github.com/idanarye), [Miroslav Kravec](https://github.com/kravemir), [Philipp Hanslovsky](https://github.com/hanslovsky) and [Jay](https://github.com/lakemove) for raising this and the subsequent discussion.
* [#629] API: Support injecting `@Spec CommandSpec spec` into `IVersionProvider` implementations. Thanks to [Garret Wilson](https://github.com/garretwilson) for raising this.
* [#795] API: Added `@Command(showAtFileInUsageHelp=true)` attribute to show `@filename` in usage help.
* [#925] API: Support `@ParentCommand`-annotated fields in mixin classes.
* [#936] API: Change visibility of `Help.subcommands()` method from protected to public.
* [#459] API: Generate manpage documentation. Thanks to [Miroslav Kravec](https://github.com/kravemir) for raising this. The `picocli-codegen` module can now generate AsciiDoc documentation that uses the `manpage` doctype and adheres to the manpage document structure so it can be converted to unix man pages in troff format with the [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#man-pages) tool.
* [#299] API: Generate AsciiDoc documentation. Thanks to [Philippe Charles](https://github.com/charphi) for raising this.
         Added a new class `picocli.codegen.docgen.manpage.ManPageGenerator` to the `picocli-codegen` module that generates AsciiDoc documentation using the `manpage` doctype and manpage document structure.
         Custom markup like `@|bold mytext|@`, `@|italic mytext|@` etc., originally intended to be converted to ANSI escape codes, can from this release also be converted to custom markup like `<b>mytext</b>` and `<i>mytext</i>` in HTML, or `*mytext*` and `_mytext_` in lightweight markup languages like AsciiDoc.
         Applications can control this by setting a `ColorScheme` with a custom markup map.
         This ticket resulted in the following additional methods: `ColorScheme::text`, `ColorScheme::string`, `ColorScheme::customMarkupMap`, `ColorScheme::parse`, `ColorScheme::resetStyle`, `ColorScheme::apply`,  `ColorScheme.Builder::customMarkupMap` (getter and setter) and a new `picocli.CommandLine.Help.Ansi.Text(String, ColorScheme)` constructor.
         The `picocli.CommandLine.Help.Ansi::apply` method is now deprecated in favor of `ColorScheme::apply`.
* [#906] Auto-completion: Added automated tests for picocli-generated bash/zsh completion scripts.

* [#920] Enhancement: Reduce `DEBUG` tracing noise if no resource bundle is set.
* [#946] Enhancement: Add `--exit` option to picocli codegen utilities.
* [#940] Bugfix: ArgGroups with a negatable option no longer cause a `NullPointerException` during initialization.
* [#938] Bugfix: ArgGroups validation now correctly reports an error when a required option is missing, while an optional subgroup is present. Thanks to [Trent Mohay](https://github.com/rain-on) for raising this.
* [#933] Bugfix: Incorrect error message when multiple exclusive groups are used. Thanks to [Mikaël Barbero](https://github.com/mbarbero) for raising this.

# <a name="4.1.4"></a> Picocli 4.1.4
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.1.4.

This release contains a bugfix for GraalVM users, and minor documentation enhancements. 

This release fixes a bug in the `picocli-codegen` annotation processor that generates an incorrect `reflect-config.json` file with invalid entries for inner classes of commands in the unnamed package, that are unnecessarily prefixed with a dot. This makes the GraalVM `native-image` generator fail with an error like "Class .Outer$Inner not found".


 
This is the sixty-sixth public release.

# <a name="4.1.2"></a> Picocli 4.1.2
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.1.2.

This release contains bugfixes, improvements, and documentation enhancements. 

This version of picocli requires JLine 3.13.2 or higher and adds a `PicocliCommands` class that provides command descriptions that can be displayed in the terminal status bar via the new JLine `TailTipWidgets` functionality.

The built-in `picocli.AutoComplete.GenerateCompletion` (`generate-completion`) subcommand now omits validation of mandatory options in the parent command.

"Hidden" subcommands and options are no longer shown as suggestions in unmatched argument usage help or autocompletion scripts.

From picocli 4.1.2, all options in an exclusive group are automatically considered required, even if they are not marked as `required = true` in the annotations. Applications using older versions of picocli should mark all options in exclusive groups as required.

# <a name="4.1.0"></a> Picocli 4.1.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.1.0.

This release contains bugfixes, and enhancements. 

The library now provides functionality that previously required custom code:

[PropertiesDefaultProvider](#4.1.0-propertiesdefaultprovider) - this release includes a built-in default provider allows end users to maintain their own default values for options and positional parameters, which may override the defaults that are hard-coded in the application.

[AutoComplete.GenerateCompletion](#4.1.0-completion) - this release includes a built-in `generate-completion` subcommand that end users can use to easily install Bash/ZSH completion for your application.

[Help API improvements](#4.1.0-helpapi) make it even easier to add custom sections to the usage help message.

This release also includes various bug fixes for [ArgGroups](#4.1.0-arggroups), which were first introduced in picocli 4.0, and are still maturing.
 
This is the sixty-second public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="4.1.0-toc"></a> Table of Contents
* [New and noteworthy](#4.1.0-new)
* [Fixed issues](#4.1.0-fixes)

###  <a name="4.1.0-propertiesdefaultprovider" id="4.1.0-propertiesdefaultprovider"></a> PropertiesDefaultProvider
From picocli 4.1, applications can use the built-in `PropertiesDefaultProvider` implementation that loads default values from a properties file.

By default, this implementation tries to find a properties file named `.${COMMAND-NAME}.properties` in the user home directory, where `${COMMAND-NAME}` is the name of the command. If a command has aliases in addition to its name, these aliases are also used to try to find the properties file. For example:

```java
import picocli.CommandLine.PropertiesDefaultProvider;
// ...
@Command(name = "git", defaultValueProvider = PropertiesDefaultProvider.class)
class Git { }
```

The above will try to load default values from `new File(System.getProperty("user.home"), ".git.properties")`.
The location of the properties file can also be controlled with system property `"picocli.defaults.${COMMAND-NAME}.path"` (`"picocli.defaults.git.path"` in this example), in which case the value of the property must be the path to the file containing the default values.

The location of the properties file may also be specified programmatically. For example:

```java
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new MyCommand());
File defaultsFile = new File("path/to/config/mycommand.properties");
cmd.setDefaultValueProvider(new PropertiesDefaultProvider(defaultsFile));
cmd.execute(args);
```


#### PropertiesDefaultProvider Format
The `PropertiesDefaultProvider` expects the properties file to be in the standard java `.properties` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties[format].

For options, the key is either the [descriptionKey](https://picocli.info/apidocs/picocli/CommandLine.Option.html#descriptionKey--), or the option's [longest name](https://picocli.info/apidocs/picocli/CommandLine.Model.OptionSpec.html#longestName--), without the prefix. So, for an option `--verbose`, the key would be `verbose`, and for an option `/F`, the key would be `F`.

For positional parameters, the key is either the [descriptionKey](https://picocli.info/apidocs/picocli/CommandLine.Parameters.html#descriptionKey--), or the positional parameter's [param label](https://picocli.info/apidocs/picocli/CommandLine.Parameters.html#paramLabel--).

End users may not know what the `descriptionKey` of your options and positional parameters are, so be sure  to document that with your application.

#### Subcommands Default Values

The default values for options and positional parameters of subcommands can be included in the properties file for the top-level command, so that end users need to maintain only a single file.
This can be achieved by prefixing the keys for the options and positional parameters with their command's qualified name.
For example, to give the  `git commit` command's `--cleanup` option a default value of `strip`, define a key of `git.commit.cleanup` and assign it a default value:

```
# /home/remko/.git.properties
git.commit.cleanup = strip
```


### <a name="4.1.0-completion"></a> AutoComplete.GenerateCompletion

This release adds a built-in `generate-completion` subcommand that generates a completion script for its parent command.

Example usage:

```java
@Command(name = "myapp",
        subcommands = picocli.AutoComplete.GenerateCompletion.class)
static class MyApp { //...
}
```

This allows users to install completion for the `myapp` command by running the following command:

```bash
source <(myapp generate-completion)
```

### Autocompletion script improvements

The generated completion script itself now enables bash completion in zsh.

That means it is no longer necessary to run the below commands in ZSH before sourcing the completion script:

```zsh
autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
```


### <a name="4.1.0-helpapi"></a> Help API improvements
The new `Help.createHeading(String, Object...)` and  `Help.createTextTable(Map<?, ?>)` methods
 facilitate creating tabular custom Help sections.
 

The below example shows how to add a custom Environment Variables section to the usage help message.

```java
// help section keys
static final String SECTION_KEY_ENV_HEADING = "environmentVariablesHeading";
static final String SECTION_KEY_ENV_DETAILS = "environmentVariables";
// ...

// the data to display
Map<String, String> env = new LinkedHashMap<>();
env.put("FOO", "explanation of foo");
env.put("BAR", "explanation of bar");
env.put("XYZ", "xxxx yyyy zzz");

// register the custom section renderers
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new MyApp());
cmd.getHelpSectionMap().put(SECTION_KEY_ENV_HEADING,
                            help -> help.createHeading("Environment Variables:%n"));
cmd.getHelpSectionMap().put(SECTION_KEY_ENV_DETAILS,
                            help -> help.createTextTable(env).toString());

// specify the location of the new sections
List<String> keys = new ArrayList<>(cmd.getHelpSectionKeys());
int index = keys.indexOf(CommandLine.Model.UsageMessageSpec.SECTION_KEY_FOOTER_HEADING);
keys.add(index, SECTION_KEY_ENV_HEADING);
keys.add(index + 1, SECTION_KEY_ENV_DETAILS);
cmd.setHelpSectionKeys(keys);
```

There are also new convenience methods `Help.fullSynopsis()` and `CommandLine.getHelp()`.

### <a name="4.1.0-arggroups"></a> ArgGroup improvements

* ArgGroups with `@Option`-annotated methods no longer fail with `NullPointerException`
* ArgGroups now match multiple occurrences of a multi-value `@Option` in the same group instance, and don't create a new group for each occurrence
* ArgGroups now don't validate when marked as `validate = false`
* ArgGroups now correctly validate that required options are present
* Non-validating ArgGroups are now automatically set to be non-exclusive

# <a name="4.0.0"></a> Picocli 4.0.0 GA
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.0. This is a big release.

First, the `picocli-codegen` module now includes an [annotation processor](#4.0.0-annotation-processor) that instantly enables your JAR for GraalVM native images. It also gives compile-time errors for invalid annotations and attributes. We recommend that all projects using picocli enable this annotation processor.

The [`execute` API](#4.0.0-execute) is an easy way to execute your command with almost no code. It allows for more flexible configuration than previous APIs, and introduces much improved exit code support. This replaces the static methods `call` and `run`, as well as the `parseWithHandlers` methods, which are now deprecated.

Improved Spring support: the new [`picocli-spring-boot-starter` module](#4.0.0-spring-boot) includes a `PicocliSpringFactory` and auto-configuration to use Spring dependency injection in your picocli command line application. This is especially useful if your application contains subcommands.

The parser has been enhanced to handle [argument groups](#4.0.0-argument-groups): mutually exclusive options, mutually dependent options, and option sections in the usage help. What makes the picocli design unique and extremely powerful is that argument groups can be nested, so applications can define repeating composite groups of mutually exclusive or co-dependent options.

Annotation attributes can now contain [variables](#4.0.0-variable-expansion) that can be resolved as system properties, environment variables and resource bundle keys.

The picocli JAR is now an [explicit JPMS module](#4.0.0-jpms-module), as well as an OSGi bundle. As part of this change, the Groovy support classes and annotations have been moved to a separate [`picocli-groovy`](#4.0.0-groovy-module) artifact.

Boolean options can now easily be made [negatable](#4.0.0-negatable-options), which adds a "no-" version of the option. This is a common feature in command line parser libraries for Perl, PHP, Ruby, Lisp, Dart and Go, but we are not aware of any other Java libraries that support this.

All in all, this release contains 96 [bugfixes and improvements](#4.0.0-fixes) over picocli 3.9.6.

### <a name="4.0.0-annotation-processor"></a> Annotation processor

<img src="https://www.graalvm.org/resources/img/logo-colored.svg" alt="GraalVM">

The `picocli-codegen` module now includes an annotation processor that instantly enables your JAR for GraalVM native images. The annotation processor can build a model from the picocli annotations at compile time rather than at runtime. 

Use this if you’re interested in:
* **Compile time error checking**. The annotation processor shows errors for invalid annotations and attributes immediately when you compile, instead of during testing at runtime, resulting in shorter feedback cycles.
* **Graal native images**. The annotation processor generates and updates [Graal configuration](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/CONFIGURE.md) files under
`META-INF/native-image/picocli-generated/$project` during compilation, to be included in the application jar.
This includes configuration files for [reflection](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/REFLECTION.md), [resources](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/RESOURCES.md) and [dynamic proxies](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/DYNAMIC_PROXY.md).
By embedding these configuration files, your jar is instantly Graal-enabled.
The `$project` location is configurable, see [processor options](#picocli-processor-options) below.
In most cases no further configuration is needed when generating a native image. 


#### Processor option: `project`

The picocli annotation processor supports a number of [options](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/tree/master/picocli-codegen#picocli-processor-options), most important of which is the `project` option to control the output subdirectory: the generated files are written to `META-INF/native-image/picocli-generated/${project}`. A good convention is to use the Maven `${groupId}/${artifactId}` as the value; a unique subdirectory ensures your jar can be shaded with other jars that may also contain generated configuration files.

To configure this option, pass the `-Aproject=<some value>` to the javac compiler. The examples below show how to do this for Maven and Gradle.

#### Enabling the Annotation Processor

Since Java 6, annotation processing is part of the standard `javac` compiler, but many IDEs and build tools require something extra to enable annotation processing. 

##### IDE
[This page](https://immutables.github.io/apt.html) shows the steps to configure Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA to enable annotation processing.

##### Maven
In Maven, use `annotationProcessorPaths` in the `configuration` of the `maven-compiler-plugin`. This requires `maven-compiler-plugin` plugin version 3.5 or higher.

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <!-- annotationProcessorPaths requires maven-compiler-plugin version 3.5 or higher -->
  <version>${maven-compiler-plugin-version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <annotationProcessorPaths>
      <path>
        <groupId>info.picocli</groupId>
        <artifactId>picocli-codegen</artifactId>
        <version>4.0.0</version>
      </path>
    </annotationProcessorPaths>
    <compilerArgs>
      <arg>-Aproject=${groupId}/${artifactId}</arg>
    </compilerArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

See the [`picocli-codegen` README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/tree/master/picocli-codegen) for more details.


##### Gradle
Use the `annotationProcessor` path in Gradle [4.6 and higher](https://docs.gradle.org/4.6/release-notes.html#convenient-declaration-of-annotation-processor-dependencies):
```
dependencies {
    compile 'info.picocli:picocli:4.0.0'
    annotationProcessor 'info.picocli:picocli-codegen:4.0.0'
}
```

To set an annotation processor option in Gradle, add these options to the `options.compilerArgs` list in the `compileJava` block. 

```
compileJava {
    options.compilerArgs += ["-Aproject=${project.group}/${project.name}"]
}
```

See the [`picocli-codegen` README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/tree/master/picocli-codegen) for more details.



### <a name="4.0.0-execute"></a> Execution API

<img src="https://picocli.info/images/executable.png" alt="executable commands">


Picocli 4.0 introduces new API to execute commands. Let’s take a quick look at what changed. 

#### Exit Code
Many command line applications return an [exit code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) to signify success or failure. Zero often means success, a non-zero exit code is often used for errors, but other than that, meanings differ per application. 

The new `CommandLine.execute` method introduced in picocli 4.0 returns an `int`, and applications can use this return value to call `System.exit` if desired. For example:

```java
public static void main(String... args) {
  CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new App());
  int exitCode = cmd.execute(args);
  System.exit(exitCode);
}
```

Older versions of picocli had some limited exit code support where picocli would call `System.exit`, but this is now deprecated.

#### Generating an Exit Code

`@Command`-annotated classes that implement `Callable` and `@Command`-annotated methods can simply return an `int` or `Integer`, and this value will be returned from `CommandLine.execute`. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "greet")
class Greet implements Callable<Integer> {
  public Integer call() {
    System.out.println("hi");
    return 1;
  }

  @Command
  int shout() {
    System.out.println("HI!");
    return 2;
  }
}

assert 1 == new CommandLine(new Greet()).execute();
assert 2 == new CommandLine(new Greet()).execute("shout");
```

Commands with a user object that implements `Runnable` can implement the `IExitCodeGenerator` interface to generate an exit code. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "wave")
class Gesture implements Runnable, IExitCodeGenerator {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("wave");
  }
  public int getExitCode() {
    return 3;
  }
}

assert 3 == new CommandLine(new Gesture()).execute();
```

#### Exception Exit Codes

By default, the `execute` method returns `CommandLine.ExitCode.USAGE` (`64`) for invalid input, and `CommandLine.ExitCode.SOFTWARE` (`70`) when an exception occurred in the Runnable, Callable or command method. (For reference, these values are `EX_USAGE` and `EX_SOFTWARE`, respectively, from Unix and Linux [sysexits.h](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysexits&sektion=3)). This can be customized with the `@Command` annotation. For example:

```java 
@Command(exitCodeOnInvalidInput = 123,
   exitCodeOnExecutionException = 456)
```

Additionally, applications can configure a `IExitCodeExceptionMapper` to map a specific exception to an exit code:

```java
class MyMapper implements IExitCodeExceptionMapper {
  public int getExitCode(Throwable t) {
    if (t instanceof FileNotFoundException) {
      return 74;
    }
    return 1;
  }
}
```

When the end user specified invalid input, the `execute` method prints an error message followed by the usage help message of the command, and returns an exit code. This can be customized by configuring a `IParameterExceptionHandler`.

If the business logic of the command throws an exception, the `execute` method prints the stack trace of the exception and returns an exit code. This can be customized by configuring a `IExecutionExceptionHandler`.


#### Configuration
The new `CommandLine.execute` method is an instance method. The older `run`, `call` and `invoke` methods are static methods. Static methods don’t allow configuration. The new API lets applications configure the parser or other aspects before execution. For example:

```java
public static void main(String... args) {
  CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new App());
  cmd.setCaseInsensitiveEnumValuesAllowed(true);
  cmd.setUnmatchedArgumentsAllowed(true);
  cmd.setStopAtPositional(true);
  cmd.setExpandAtFiles(false);
  cmd.execute(args);
}
```


### <a name="4.0.0-spring-boot"></a> Spring support

<img src="https://picocli.info/images/spring-boot.png" alt="spring and spring boot logos" width="350" height="167">

[Thibaud Lepretre](https://github.com/kakawait), the author of [kakawait/picocli-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/kakawait/picocli-spring-boot-starter) has graciously contributed a pull request to the picocli project with a new `picocli-spring-boot-starter` module. This includes a `PicocliSpringFactory` and auto-configuration and makes it extremely easy to use Spring dependency injection in your picocli command line application.


#### Spring Boot example

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.ExitCodeGenerator;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.IFactory;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MySpringApp implements CommandLineRunner, ExitCodeGenerator {
    private int exitCode;

    @Autowired
    IFactory factory; // auto-configured to inject PicocliSpringFactory

    @Autowired
    MyCommand myCommand; // your @picocli.CommandLine.Command-annotated class

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) {
        // let picocli parse command line args and run the business logic
        exitCode = new CommandLine(myCommand, factory).execute(args);
    }

    @Override
    public int getExitCode() {
        return exitCode;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // let Spring instantiate and inject dependencies
        System.exit(SpringApplication.exit(SpringApplication.run(MySpringApp.class, args)));
    }
}
```

When your command is annotated with `@Component`, Spring can autodetect it for dependency injection.
The business logic of your command looks like any other picocli command with options and parameters.

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import picocli.CommandLine.Command;
import picocli.CommandLine.Option;
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;

@Component
@Command(name = "myCommand")
public class MyCommand implements Callable<Integer> {

    @Autowired
    private SomeService someService;

    // Prevent "Unknown option" error when users use
    // the Spring Boot parameter 'spring.config.location' to specify
    // an alternative location for the application.properties file.
    @Option(names = "--spring.config.location", hidden = true)
    private String springConfigLocation;

    @Option(names = { "-x", "--option" }, description = "example option")
    private boolean flag;

    public Integer call() throws Exception {
        // business logic here
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### <a name="4.0.0-argument-groups"></a> Argument groups
<img src="https://picocli.info/images/groups.jpg" alt="argument groups">

This release introduces a new `@ArgGroup` annotation and its `ArgGroupSpec` programmatic equivalent.

Argument Groups can be used to define:

* mutually exclusive options
* options that must co-occur (dependent options)
* option sections in the usage help message
* repeating composite arguments

To create a group using the annotations API, annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup`.
The field's type refers to the class containing the options and positional parameters in the group.
(For annotated interface methods this would be the return type, for annotated setter methods in a concrete class this would be the setter's parameter type.)

Picocli will instantiate this class as necessary to capture command line argument values in the `@Option` and `@Parameters`-annotated fields and methods of this class.

#### Mutually Exclusive Options

Annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup(exclusive = true)` to create a group of mutually exclusive options and positional parameters. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "exclusivedemo")
public class MutuallyExclusiveOptionsDemo {

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = true, multiplicity = "1")
    Exclusive exclusive;

    static class Exclusive {
        @Option(names = "-a", required = true) int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", required = true) int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", required = true) int c;
    }
}
```

The above example defines a command with mutually exclusive options `-a`, `-b` and `-c`.

The group itself has a `multiplicity` attribute that defines how many times the group may be specified within the command.
The default is `multiplicity = "0..1"`, meaning that by default a group may be omitted or specified once.
In this example the group has `multiplicity = "1"`, so the group must occur once: one of the exclusive options must occur on the command line.

The synopsis of this command is `exclusivedemo (-a=<a> | -b=<b> | -c=<c>)`.

Note that the options are defined as `required = true`; this means required _within the group_, not required within the command.

Picocli will validate the arguments and throw a `MutuallyExclusiveArgsException` if multiple mutually exclusive arguments were specified. For example:

```java
MutuallyExclusiveOptionsDemo example = new MutuallyExclusiveOptionsDemo();
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(example);

try {
    cmd.parseArgs("-a=1", "-b=2");
} catch (MutuallyExclusiveArgsException ex) {
    assert "Error: -a=<a>, -b=<b> are mutually exclusive (specify only one)"
            .equals(ex.getMessage());
}
```

For the above group, only one of the options can be specified. Any other combination of options, or the absence of options, is invalid.

#### Mutually Dependent Options

Annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup(exclusive = false)` to create a group of dependent options and positional parameters that must co-occur. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "co-occur")
public class DependentOptionsDemo {

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = false)
    Dependent dependent;

    static class Dependent {
        @Option(names = "-a", required = true) int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", required = true) int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", required = true) int c;
    }
}
```

The above example defines a command with dependent options `-a`, `-b` and `-c` that must co-occur.

The group itself has a `multiplicity` attribute that defines how many times the group may be specified within the command.
In this example the group uses the default multiplicity, `multiplicity = "0..1"`, meaning that the group may be omitted or specified once.

The synopsis of this command is `co-occur [-a=<a> -b=<b> -c=<c>]`.

Note that the options are defined as `required = true`; this means required _within the group_, not required within the command.

Picocli will validate the arguments and throw a `MissingParameterException` if not all dependent arguments were specified. For example:

```java
DependentOptionsDemo example = new DependentOptionsDemo();
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(example);

try {
    cmd.parseArgs("-a=1", "-b=2");
} catch (MissingParameterException ex) {
    assert "Error: Missing required argument(s): -c=<c>".equals(ex.getMessage());
}
```

#### Option Sections in Usage Help

The example below uses groups to define options sections in the usage help.
When a group has a non-null `heading` (or `headingKey`), the options in the group are given the specified heading in the usage help message.
The `headingKey` attribute can be used to get the heading text from the command's resource bundle.

This works for mutually exclusive or co-occurring groups, but it is also possible to define a group that does no validation but only creates an option section in the usage help.

Annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup(validate = false)` to create a group for display purposes only. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "sectiondemo", description = "Section demo")
public class OptionSectionDemo {

    @ArgGroup(validate = false, heading = "This is the first section%n")
    Section1 section1;

    static class Section1 {
        @Option(names = "-a", description = "Option A") int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", description = "Option B") int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", description = "Option C") int c;
    }

    @ArgGroup(validate = false, heading = "This is the second section%n")
    Section2 section2;

    static class Section2 {
        @Option(names = "-x", description = "Option X") int x;
        @Option(names = "-y", description = "Option Y") int y;
        @Option(names = "-z", description = "Option X") int z;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new CommandLine(new OptionSectionDemo()).usage(System.out);
    }
}
```

This prints the following usage help message:
```
Usage: sectiondemo [-a=<a>] [-b=<b>] [-c=<c>] [-x=<x>] [-y=<y>] [-z=<z>]
Section demo
This is the first section
  -a=<a>    Option A
  -b=<b>    Option B
  -c=<c>    Option C
This is the second section
  -x=<x>    Option X
  -y=<y>    Option Y
  -z=<z>    Option X
```

Note that the heading text must end with `%n` to insert a newline between the heading text and the first option.
This is for consistency with other headings in the usage help, like `@Command(headerHeading = "Usage:%n", optionListHeading = "%nOptions:%n")`.

#### Repeating Composite Argument Groups

The below example shows how groups can be composed of other groups, and how arrays and collections can be used to capture repeating groups (with a `multiplicity` greater than one):

```java
@Command(name = "repeating-composite-demo")
public class CompositeGroupDemo {

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = false, multiplicity = "1..*")
    List<Composite> composites;

    static class Composite {
        @ArgGroup(exclusive = false, multiplicity = "0..1")
        Dependent dependent;

        @ArgGroup(exclusive = true, multiplicity = "1")
        Exclusive exclusive;
    }

    static class Dependent {
        @Option(names = "-a", required = true) int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", required = true) int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", required = true) int c;
    }

    static class Exclusive {
        @Option(names = "-x", required = true) boolean x;
        @Option(names = "-y", required = true) boolean y;
        @Option(names = "-z", required = true) boolean z;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the annotated `composites` field defines a composite group that must be specified at least once, and may be specified many times (`multiplicity = "1..*"`), on the command line.

The synopsis of this command is:

```
Usage: repeating-composite-demo ([-a=<a> -b=<b> -c=<c>] (-x | -y | -z))...
```

Each time the group is matched, picocli creates an instance of the `Composite` class and adds it to the `composites` list.

The `Composite` class itself contains two groups: an optional (`multiplicity = "0..1"`) group of dependent options that must co-occur, and another group of mutually exclusive options, which is mandatory (`multiplicity = "1"`).

The below example illustrates:

```java
CompositeGroupDemo example = new CompositeGroupDemo();
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(example);

cmd.parseArgs("-x", "-a=1", "-b=1", "-c=1", "-a=2", "-b=2", "-c=2", "-y");
assert example.composites.size() == 2;

Composite c1 = example.composites.get(0);
assert c1.exclusive.x;
assert c1.dependent.a == 1;
assert c1.dependent.b == 1;
assert c1.dependent.c == 1;

Composite c2 = example.composites.get(1);
assert c2.exclusive.y;
assert c2.dependent.a == 2;
assert c2.dependent.b == 2;
assert c2.dependent.c == 2;
```

#### Positional Parameters

When a `@Parameters` positional parameter is part of a group, its `index` is the index _within the group_, not within the command.


### <a name="4.0.0-variable-expansion"></a> Variable expansion
From this release, picocli supports variable interpolation (variable expansion) in annotation attributes as well as in text attributes of the programmatic API.

#### Variable Interpolation Example

```java
@Command(name = "status", description = "This command logs the status for ${PARENT-COMMAND-NAME}.")
class Status {
    @Option(names = {"${dirOptionName1:--d}", "${dirOptionName2:---directories}"}, // -d or --directories
            description = {"Specify one or more directories, separated by '${sys:path.separator}'.",
                           "The default is the user home directory (${DEFAULT-VALUE})."},  
            arity = "${sys:dirOptionArity:-1..*}",
            defaultValue = "${sys:user.home}",
            split = "${sys:path.separator}")
    String[] directories;
}
```

#### Predefined Variables

See the [user manual](https://picocli.info/#_predefined_variables) for the list of predefined variables.

#### Custom Variables

In addition, you can define your own variables. Currently the following syntaxes are supported:

* `${sys:key}`: system property lookup, replaced by the value of `System.getProperty("key")`
* `${env:key}`: environment variable lookup, replaced by the value of `System.getEnv("key")`
* `${bundle:key}`: look up the value of `key` in the resource bundle of the command
* `${key}`: search all of the above, first system properties, then environment variables, and finally the resource bundle of the command

#### Default Values for Custom Variables

You can specify a default value to use when no value is found for a custom variable. The syntax for specifying a default is `${a:-b}`, where `a` is the variable name and `b` is the default value to use if `a` is not found.


### <a name="4.0.0-jpms-module"></a> Explicit JPMS module
<img src="https://picocli.info/images/modules.jpg" alt="modules">

The main `picocli-4.0.0.jar` is a JPMS module named `info.picocli`.

Starting from picocli 4.0, this jar will be an explicit module instead of an automatic module, so the [`jlink` tool](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/tools/jlink.html) can be used to provide a trimmed binary image that has only the required modules.

Typically, a modular jar includes the `module-info.class` file in its root directory. This causes problems for some older tools, which incorrectly process the module descriptor as if it were a normal Java class. To provide the best backward compatibility, the main picocli artifact is a [modular multi-release jar](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238#Modular-multi-release-JAR-files) with the `module-info.class` file located in `META-INF/versions/9`.

### <a name="4.0.0-groovy-module"></a> Separate `picocli-groovy` module

<img src="https://picocli.info/images/groovy-logo.png" alt="Groovy logo">

Also, from this release the main `picocli-4.x` artifact no longer contains the `picocli.groovy` classes: these have been split off into a separate `picocli-groovy-4.x` artifact. This was necessary to make the main `picocli-4.x.jar` an explicit JPMS module.


### <a name="4.0.0-negatable-options"></a> Negatable options
From picocli 4.0, options can be `negatable`.

```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "--verbose",           negatable = true) boolean verbose;
    @Option(names = "-XX:+PrintGCDetails", negatable = true) boolean printGCDetails;
    @Option(names = "-XX:-UseG1GC",        negatable = true) boolean useG1GC = true;
}
```

When an option is negatable, picocli will recognize negative aliases of the option on the command line.

For *nix-style long options, aliases have the prefix 'no-' to the given names.
For Java JVM-style options, the `:+` is turned into `:-` and vice versa. (This can be changed by customizing the `INegatableOptionTransformer`.)

If the negated form of the option is found, for example `--no-verbose`, the value is set to the provided default. Otherwise, with a regular call, for example `--verbose`, it is set to the opposite of the default.

### <a name="4.0.0-fallback-values"></a> Fallback value for options
This release introduces a new attribute on the `Option` annotation: `fallbackValue` for options with optional parameter: assign this value when the option was specified on the command line without parameter.

This is different from the `defaultValue`, which is assigned if the option is not specified at all on the command line.

Using a `fallbackValue` allows applications to distinguish between cases where
* the option was not specified on the command line (default value assigned)
* the option was specified without parameter on the command line (fallback value assigned)
* the option was specified with parameter on the command line (command line argument value assigned)

This is useful to define options that can function as a boolean "switch" and optionally allow users to provide a (strongly typed) extra parameter value.

The option description may contain the `${FALLBACK-VALUE}` variable which will be replaced with the actual fallback value when the usage help is shown.


### <a name="4.0.0-parameterConsumer"></a> Custom parameter processing
Options or positional parameters can be assigned a `IParameterConsumer` that implements custom logic to process the parameters for this option or this position. When an option or positional parameter with a custom `IParameterConsumer` is matched on the command line, picocli's internal parser is temporarily suspended, and the custom parameter consumer becomes responsible for consuming and processing as many command line arguments as needed.

This can be useful when passing options through to another command.

For example, the unix [`find`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)) command has a [`-exec`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)#Execute_an_action) option to execute some action for each file found. Any arguments following the `-exec` option until a `;` or `+` argument are not options for the `find` command itself, but are interpreted as a separate command and its options.

The example below demonstrates how to implement `find -exec` using this API:

```java
@Command(name = "find")
class Find {
    @Option(names = "-exec", parameterConsumer = ExecParameterConsumer.class)
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
}

class ExecParameterConsumer implements IParameterConsumer {
    public void consumeParameters(Stack<String> args, ArgSpec argSpec, CommandSpec commandSpec) {
        List<String> list = argSpec.getValue();
        while (!args.isEmpty()) {
            String arg = args.pop();
            list.add(arg);

            // `find -exec` semantics: stop processing after a ';' or '+' argument
            if (";".equals(arg) || "+".equals(arg)) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### <a name="4.0.0-quoted-params"></a> Improved parsing of quoted parameters
Also, from this release, support for quoted parameter values has been improved. Quoted parameter values can now contain nested quoted substrings to give end users fine-grained control over how values are split. See the [user manual](https://picocli.info/#_quoted_values) for details.

### <a name="4.0.0-auto-width"></a> Auto-detect terminal width for usage help
From this release, commands defined with `@Command(usageHelpAutoWidth = true)` will try to adjust the usage message help layout to the terminal width.
There is also programmatic API to control this via the `CommandLine::setUsageHelpAutoWidth` and `UsageMessageSpec::autoWidth` methods.

End users may enable this by setting system property `picocli.usage.width` to `AUTO`, and may disable this by setting this system property to a numeric value.

This feature requires Java 7.


### <a name="4.0.0-cjk"></a> Improved support for Chinese, Japanese and Korean usage help
Picocli will align the usage help message to fit within some user-defined width (80 columns by default).
A number of characters in Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are wider than others.
If those characters are treated to have the same width as other characters, the usage help message may extend past the right margin.

From this release, picocli will use 2 columns for these wide characters when calculating where to put line breaks, resulting in better usage help message text.

This can be switched off with `CommandLine.setAdjustLineBreaksForWideCJKCharacters(false)`.

## <a name="4.0.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations

### <a name="4.0.0-deprecated-run-call"></a> `run`, `call`, `invoke`, and `parseWithHandlers` methods replaced by `execute`
All variants of the `run`, `call`, `invoke`, and `parseWithHandlers` methods are deprecated from this release, in favor of the new `execute` method.

Similarly, the following classes and interfaces are deprecated:

* `IParseResultHandler2` is deprecated in favor of the new `IExecutionStrategy` interface.
* `IExceptionHandler2` is deprecated in favor of the new `IParameterExceptionHandler` `IExecutionExceptionHandler` interfaces.
* The `AbstractHandler` and `AbstractParseResultHandler` classes are deprecated with no replacement.

### <a name="4.0.0-deprecated-setSplitQuotedStrings"></a> `CommandLine.setSplitQuotedStrings` deprecated
The `CommandLine.setSplitQuotedStrings` (and `isSplitQuotedStrings`) methods have been deprecated:
Most applications should not change the default. The rare application that _does_ need to split parameter values without respecting quotes should use [`ParserSpec.splitQuotedStrings(boolean)`](https://picocli.info/apidocs/picocli/CommandLine.Model.ParserSpec.html#splitQuotedStrings-boolean-).

### <a name="4.0.0-deprecated-parse"></a> `parse` deprecated in favor of `parseArgs`
From this release, the `parse` method is deprecated in favor of `parseArgs`.

### <a name="4.0.0-deprecated-range-public-fields"></a> Range public fields
The public fields of the `Range` class have been deprecated and public methods `min()`, `max()`, `isVariable()` have been added that should be used instead.


## <a name="4.0.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-groovy"></a> `picocli.groovy` classes moved to separate artifact
From this release the main `picocli-4.x` artifact no longer contains the `picocli.groovy` classes: these have been split off into a separate `picocli-groovy-4.x` artifact.

Scripts upgrading to picocli 4.0 must change more than just the version number!
Scripts should use `@Grab('info.picocli:picocli-groovy:4.x')` from version 4.0, `@Grab('info.picocli:picocli:4.x')` will not work.

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-split"></a> Split regex on single-value options is now disallowed
Picocli now throws an `InitializationException` when a single-value type option or positional parameter has a `split` regex.
Only multi-value options or positional parameters should have a `split` regex. The runtime check can be disabled by setting system property `picocli.ignore.invalid.split` to any value.
(The annotation processor also checks this at compile time; this check cannot be disabled.)

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-colorscheme"></a> ColorScheme is now immutable
The `Help.ColorScheme` class has been made immutable. Its public fields are no longer public.
A new `Help.ColorScheme.Builder` class has been introduced to create `ColorScheme` instances.

This is a breaking API change: I could not think of a way to do this without breaking backwards compatibility.

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-toggle"></a> Boolean options do not toggle by default
From this release, when a flag option is specified on the command line picocli will set its value to the opposite of its _default_ value.

Prior to 4.0, the default was to "toggle" boolean flags to the opposite of their _current_ value:
if the previous value was `true` it is set to `false`, and when the value was `false` it is set to `true`.

Applications can call `CommandLine.setToggleBooleanFlags(true)` to enable toggling.
Note that when toggling is enabled, specifying a flag option twice on the command line will have no effect because they cancel each other out.

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-matchedOptions"></a> ParseResult `matchedOptions` now returns full list
`ParseResult.matchedOptions()` and `ParseResult.matchedPositionals()` now return the full list of matched options and positional parameters, including duplicates if the option or positional parameter was matched multiple times.
Prior to this release, these methods would return a list that did not contain duplicates. 
Applications interested in the old behavior should use the new `matchedOptionSet()` and `matchedPositionalSet()` methods that return a `Set`.

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-unmatched-error"></a> Error message for unmatched arguments changed
The error message for unmatched arguments now shows the index in the command line arguments where the unmatched argument was found,
and shows the unmatched value in single quotes. This is useful when the unmatched value is whitespace or an empty String.

For example:

```
Previously:  Unmatched arguments: B, C
New       :  Unmatched arguments from index 1: 'B', 'C'
```

This may break tests that rely on the exact error message.

### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-option-order"></a> Option order changed 
Previously, options that only have a long name (and do not have a short name) were always shown before options with a short name.
From this release, they are inserted in the option list by their first non-prefix letter.
This may break tests that expect a specific help message.


### <a name="4.0.0-breaking-factory"></a> Factory 

From version 4.0, picocli delegates all object creation to the [factory](https://picocli.info/#_custom_factory), including creating `Collection` instances to capture [multi-value](https://picocli.info/#_arrays_and_collections) `@Option` values. Previously, `Collection` objects were instantiated separately without involving the factory.

It is recommended that custom factories should fall back to the default factory. Something like this:

```java
@Override
public <K> K create(Class<K> clazz) throws Exception {
    try {
        return doCreate(clazz); // custom factory lookup or instantiation
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return CommandLine.defaultFactory().create(clazz); // fallback if missing
    }
}
```




# <a name="4.0.0-beta-2"></a> Picocli 4.0.0-beta-2
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.0.0-beta-2.

Bugfixes and improvements.

This release introduces two new attributes on the `Option` annotation: 

* `fallbackValue`
* `parameterConsumer`

`fallbackValue` is for options with optional parameter: assign this value when the option was specified on the command line without parameter. `parameterConsumer` and the associated `IParameterConsumer` interface allows for options to bypass picocli's parsing logic and replace it with custom logic. One use case is collecting arguments to pass them through to another command.

This release introduces a new `synopsisSubcommandLabel` attribute on the `@Command` annotation to allow customization of the subcommands part of the synopsis. This is useful for applications that have required subcommands.

Also, this release adds the ability to dynamically detect the terminal width.

From this release, the picocli JAR is an OSGi bundle with `Bundle-Name: picocli` and other appropriate metadata in the manifest.

_Please try this and provide feedback. We can still make changes._

_What do you think of the `@ArgGroup` annotations API? What about the programmatic API? Does it work as expected? Are the input validation error messages correct and clear? Is the documentation clear and complete? Anything you want to change or improve? Any other feedback?_


Many thanks to the picocli community for the contributions!

This is the fifty-sixth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="4.0.0-beta-2-new"></a> New and Noteworthy

### Fallback Value API
This release introduces a new attribute on the `Option` annotation: `fallbackValue` for options with optional parameter: assign this value when the option was specified on the command line without parameter.

This is different from the `defaultValue`, which is assigned if the option is not specified at all on the command line.

Using a `fallbackValue` allows applications to distinguish between cases where
* the option was not specified on the command line (default value assigned)
* the option was specified without parameter on the command line (fallback value assigned)
* the option was specified with parameter on the command line (command line argument value assigned)

This is useful to define options that can function as a boolean "switch" and optionally allow users to provide a (strongly typed) extra parameter value.

The option description may contain the `${FALLBACK-VALUE}` variable which will be replaced with the actual fallback value when the usage help is shown.


### Synopsis Subcommand Label
For commands with subcommands, the string `[COMMAND]` is appended to the end of the synopsis (whether the synopsis is abbreviated or not). This looks something like this:

```
<cmd> [OPTIONS] FILES [COMMAND]
```

From picocli 4.0, this can be customized with the `synopsisSubcommandLabel` attribute.

For example, to clarify that a subcommand is mandatory, an application may specify `COMMAND`, without the `[` and `]` brackets:

```java
@Command(name = "git", synopsisSubcommandLabel = "COMMAND")
class Git implements Runnable {
    @Spec CommandSpec spec;
    public void run() {
        throw new ParameterException(spec.commandLine(), "Missing required subcommand");
    }
}
```

An application with a limited number of subcommands may want to show them all in the synopsis, for example:

```java
@Command(name = "fs", synopsisSubcommandLabel = "(list | add | delete)",
         subcommands = {List.class, Add.class, Delete.class})
class Fs { ... }
```

### Dynamically Detect Terminal Size

From this release, commands defined with `@Command(usageHelpAutoWidth = true)` will try to adjust the usage message help layout to the terminal width.
There is also programmatic API to control this via the `CommandLine::setUsageHelpAutoWidth` and `UsageMessageSpec::autoWidth` methods.

End users may enable this by setting system property `picocli.usage.width` to `AUTO`, and may disable this by setting this system property to a numeric value.

This feature requires Java 7.

### Custom Parameter Processing
    
Options or positional parameters can be assigned a `IParameterConsumer` that implements custom logic to process the parameters for this option or this position. When an option or positional parameter with a custom `IParameterConsumer` is matched on the command line, picocli's internal parser is temporarily suspended, and the custom parameter consumer becomes responsible for consuming and processing as many command line arguments as needed.

This can be useful when passing options through to another command.

For example, the unix [`find`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)) command has a [`-exec`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix)#Execute_an_action) option to execute some action for each file found. Any arguments following the `-exec` option until a `;` or `+` argument are not options for the `find` command itself, but are interpreted as a separate command and its options.

The example below demonstrates how to implement `find -exec` using this API:

```java
@Command(name = "find")
class Find {
    @Option(names = "-exec", parameterConsumer = ExecParameterConsumer.class)
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
}

class ExecParameterConsumer implements IParameterConsumer {
    public void consumeParameters(Stack<String> args, ArgSpec argSpec, CommandSpec commandSpec) {
        List<String> list = argSpec.getValue();
        while (!args.isEmpty()) {
            String arg = args.pop();
            list.add(arg);

            // `find -exec` semantics: stop processing after a ';' or '+' argument
            if (";".equals(arg) || "+".equals(arg)) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## <a name="4.0.0-beta-2-deprecated"></a> Deprecations
From this release, the `parse` method is deprecated in favor of `parseArgs`.

## <a name="4.0.0-beta-2-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

The error message for unmatched arguments now shows the index in the command line arguments where the unmatched argument was found,
and shows the unmatched value in single quotes. This is useful when the unmatched value is whitespace or an empty String.

For example:

```
Previously:  Unmatched arguments: B, C
New       :  Unmatched arguments from index 1: 'B', 'C'
```

This may break tests that rely on the exact error message.





# <a name="4.0.0-beta-1b"></a> Picocli 4.0.0-beta-1b
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.0.0-beta-1b.

This release includes the first cut of an annotation processor that can build a model from the picocli annotations at compile time rather than at runtime. 

Use this if you’re interested in:
* **Compile time error checking**. The annotation processor shows errors for invalid annotations and attributes immediately when you compile, instead of during testing at runtime, resulting in shorter feedback cycles.
* **Graal native images**. The annotation processor generates [Graal configuration](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/CONFIGURE.md)
files under `META-INF/native-image/picocli-generated/$project` during compilation, to be included in the application jar.
By embedding these configuration files, your jar is instantly Graal-enabled.
In most cases no further configuration is needed when generating a native image. 

Also, from this release the main `picocli-4.x` artifact no longer contains the `picocli.groovy` classes: these have been split off into a separate `picocli-groovy-4.x` artifact.
The main `picocli-4.x.jar` is now an explicit JPMS module, with a `module-info.class` located in `META-INF/versions/9`.
The `picocli-jpms-module` subproject has been removed.

From picocli 4.0, options can be `negatable`.
When an option is negatable, picocli will recognize negative aliases of the option on the command line. See the New and Noteworthy section below for more details. 


_Please try this and provide feedback. We can still make changes._

_What do you think of the `@ArgGroup` annotations API? What about the programmatic API? Does it work as expected? Are the input validation error messages correct and clear? Is the documentation clear and complete? Anything you want to change or improve? Any other feedback?_


Many thanks to the picocli community for the contributions!

This is the fifty-fifth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### <a name="4.0.0-beta-1b-processor"></a> Annotation Processor

This release includes the first cut of an annotation processor that can build a model from the picocli annotations at compile time rather than at runtime. 

Use this if you’re interested in:
* **Compile time error checking**. The annotation processor shows errors for invalid annotations and attributes immediately when you compile, instead of during testing at runtime, resulting in shorter feedback cycles.
* **Graal native images**. The annotation processor generates and updates [Graal configuration](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/CONFIGURE.md) files under
`META-INF/native-image/picocli-generated/$project` during compilation, to be included in the application jar.
This includes configuration files for [reflection](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/REFLECTION.md), [resources](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/RESOURCES.md) and [dynamic proxies](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/DYNAMIC_PROXY.md).
By embedding these configuration files, your jar is instantly Graal-enabled.
The `$project` location is configurable, see [processor options](#picocli-processor-options) below.
In most cases no further configuration is needed when generating a native image. 

#### Enabling the Annotation Processor

Since Java 6, annotation processing is part of the standard `javac` compiler, but many IDEs and build tools require something extra to enable annotation processing. 

##### IDE
[This page](https://immutables.github.io/apt.html) shows the steps to configure Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA to enable annotation processing.

##### Maven
In Maven, use `annotationProcessorPaths` in the `configuration` of the `maven-compiler-plugin`.
This requires `maven-compiler-plugin` plugin version 3.5 or higher.

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
  <!-- annotationProcessorPaths requires maven-compiler-plugin version 3.5 or higher -->
  <version>${maven-compiler-plugin-version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <annotationProcessorPaths>
      <path>
        <groupId>info.picocli</groupId>
        <artifactId>picocli-codegen</artifactId>
        <version>4.0.0-beta-1b</version>
      </path>
    </annotationProcessorPaths>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

An alternative that works with older versions of the `maven-compiler-plugin` is to specify the `picocli-codegen` module on the classpath as a `provided` dependency. This also prevents the `picocli-codegen` module from being included in the artifact the module produces as a transitive dependency. 

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.picocli</groupId>
  <artifactId>picocli</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0-beta-1b</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>info.picocli</groupId>
  <artifactId>picocli-codegen</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0-beta-1b</version>
  <provided>true</provided>
</dependency>
```


See Processor Options below. 


##### Gradle
Use the `annotationProcessor` path in Gradle [4.6 and higher](https://docs.gradle.org/4.6/release-notes.html#convenient-declaration-of-annotation-processor-dependencies):
```
dependencies {
    compile 'info.picocli:picocli:4.0.0-beta-1b'
    annotationProcessor 'info.picocli:picocli-codegen:4.0.0-beta-1b'
}
```

For Gradle versions prior to 4.6, use `compileOnly`, to prevent the `picocli-codegen` jar from being a transitive dependency included in the artifact the module produces.
```
dependencies {
    compile 'info.picocli:picocli:4.0.0-beta-1b'
    compileOnly 'info.picocli:picocli-codegen:4.0.0-beta-1b'
}
```

#### Picocli Processor Options

The picocli annotation processor supports the options below.

##### Recommended Options
* `project` - output subdirectory

The generated files are written to `META-INF/native-image/picocli-generated/${project}`. 

The `project` option can be omitted, but it is a good idea to specify the `project` option with a unique value for your project (e.g. `${groupId}/${artifactId}`) if your jar may be [shaded](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49811665) with other jars into an uberjar.


##### Other Options
* `other.resource.patterns` - comma-separated list of regular expressions matching additional resources to include in the image
* `other.resource.bundles` - comma-separated list of the base names of additional resource bundles to include in the image
* `other.proxy.interfaces` - comma-separated list of the fully qualified class names of additional interfaces for which to generate proxy classes when building the image
* `disable.proxy.config` - don’t generate `proxy-config.json`
* `disable.reflect.config` - don’t generate `reflect-config.json`
* `disable.resource.config` - don’t generate `resources-config.json`


##### Javac
To pass an annotation processor option with `javac`, specify the `-A` command line option:

```
javac -Aproject=org.myorg.myproject/myapp -cp ...
```
The `-A` option lets you pass options to annotation processors. See the [javac documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/javac.html) for details.

##### Maven

To set an annotation processor option in Maven, you need to use the `maven-compiler-plugin` and configure the `compilerArgs` section. 

```
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <!-- annotationProcessorPaths requires maven-compiler-plugin version 3.5 or higher -->
      <version>${maven-compiler-plugin-version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <compilerArgs>
          <arg>-Aproject=${groupId}/${artifactId}</arg>
        </compilerArgs>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

See https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html for details. 

#### Gradle Example
To set an annotation processor option in Gradle, add these options to the `options.compilerArgs` list in the `compileJava` block. 

```
compileJava {
    // minimum 1.6
    sourceCompatibility = ${java-version}
    targetCompatibility = ${java-version}
    options.compilerArgs += ["-Aproject=${project.group}/${project.name}"]
}
```

See the [Gradle documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.compile.CompileOptions.html) for details.


### <a name="4.0.0-beta-1b-negatable"></a> Negatable Options
From picocli 4.0, options can be `negatable`.

```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "--verbose",           negatable = true) boolean verbose;
    @Option(names = "-XX:+PrintGCDetails", negatable = true) boolean printGCDetails;
    @Option(names = "-XX:-UseG1GC",        negatable = true) boolean useG1GC = true;
}
```

When an option is negatable, picocli will recognize negative aliases of the option on the command line.

For *nix-style long options, aliases have the prefix 'no-' to the given names.
For Java JVM-style options, the `:+` is turned into `:-` and vice versa. (This can be changed by customizing the `INegatableOptionTransformer`.)

If the negated form of the option is found, for example `--no-verbose`, the value is set to the provided default. Otherwise, with a regular call, for example `--verbose`, it is set to the opposite of the default.

## <a name="4.0.0-beta-1b-deprecated"></a> Deprecations


## <a name="4.0.0-beta-1b-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

### `picocli.groovy` Classes Moved to Separate Artifact
From this release the main `picocli-4.x` artifact no longer contains the `picocli.groovy` classes: these have been split off into a separate `picocli-groovy-4.x` artifact.

Scripts upgrading to picocli 4.0 must change more than just the version number!
Scripts should use `@Grab('info.picocli:picocli-groovy:4.x')` from version 4.0, `@Grab('info.picocli:picocli:4.x')` will not work.

### Option Order Changed 
Previously, options that only have a long name (and do not have a short name) were always shown before options with a short name.
From this release, they are inserted in the option list by their first non-prefix letter.
This may break tests that expect a specific help message.

### Boolean Options Do Not Toggle By Default
From this release, when a flag option is specified on the command line picocli will set its value to the opposite of its _default_ value.

Prior to 4.0, the default was to "toggle" boolean flags to the opposite of their _current_ value:
if the previous value was `true` it is set to `false`, and when the value was `false` it is set to `true`.

Applications can call `CommandLine.setToggleBooleanFlags(true)` to enable toggling.
Note that when toggling is enabled, specifying a flag option twice on the command line will have no effect because they cancel each other out.

### Revert `@Inherited` annotation on `@Command`
The `@Inherited` annotated that was added to `@Command` in picocli 4.0.0-alpha-2 turned out to cause 
issues in scenarios with multiple levels of inheritance and is reverted in this release.


# <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3"></a> Picocli 4.0.0-alpha-3
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.0.0-alpha-3.

This release adds improved support for command execution via the new `execute` method.
This method returns an exit code that applications can use to call `System.exit`.

The older `run`, `call`, `invoke` and `parseWithHandlers` convenience methods that were similar to `execute` but had limited support for parser configuration and and limited support for exit codes are deprecated from this release.

This release also improves the picocli tools for configuring GraalVM native image builds: there is now support for commands with resource bundles and jewelcli-style `@Command`-annotated interfaces for which picocli generates a dynamic proxy.

_Please try this and provide feedback. We can still make changes._

_What do you think of the `@ArgGroup` annotations API? What about the programmatic API? Does it work as expected? Are the input validation error messages correct and clear? Is the documentation clear and complete? Anything you want to change or improve? Any other feedback?_


Many thanks to the picocli community for the contributions!

This is the fifty-fourth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3"></a> Table of Contents
* [New and noteworthy](#4.0.0-alpha-3-new)
* [Fixed issues](#4.0.0-alpha-3-fixes)
* [Deprecations](#4.0.0-alpha-3-deprecated)
* [Potential breaking changes](#4.0.0-alpha-3-breaking-changes)

## <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3-new"></a> New and Noteworthy

### <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3-execute"></a> Executing Commands

Picocli 4.0 introduces new API to execute commands. Let’s take a quick look at what changed. 

#### Exit Code
Many command line applications return an [exit code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) to signify success or failure. Zero often means success, a non-zero exit code is often used for errors, but other than that, meanings differ per application. 

The new `CommandLine.execute` method introduced in picocli 4.0 returns an `int`, and applications can use this return value to call `System.exit` if desired. For example:

```java
public static void main(String... args) {
  CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new App());
  int exitCode = cmd.execute(args);
  System.exit(exitCode);
}
```

Older versions of picocli had some limited exit code support where picocli would call `System.exit`, but this is now deprecated.

#### Generating an Exit Code

`@Command`-annotated classes that implement `Callable` and `@Command`-annotated methods can simply return an `int` or `Integer`, and this value will be returned from `CommandLine.execute`. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "greet")
class Greet implements Callable<Integer> {
  public Integer call() {
    System.out.println("hi");
    return 1;
  }

  @Command
  int shout() {
    System.out.println("HI!");
    return 2;
  }
}

assert 1 == new CommandLine(new Greet()).execute();
assert 2 == new CommandLine(new Greet()).execute("shout");
```

Commands with a user object that implements `Runnable` can implement the `IExitCodeGenerator` interface to generate an exit code. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "wave")
class Gesture implements Runnable, IExitCodeGenerator {
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("wave");
  }
  public int getExitCode() {
    return 3;
  }
}

assert 3 == new CommandLine(new Gesture()).execute();
```

#### Exception Exit Codes

By default, the `execute` method returns `CommandLine.ExitCode.USAGE` (`64`) for invalid input, and `CommandLine.ExitCode.SOFTWARE` (`70`) when an exception occurred in the Runnable, Callable or command method. (For reference, these values are `EX_USAGE` and `EX_SOFTWARE`, respectively, from Unix and Linux [sysexits.h](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sysexits&sektion=3)). This can be customized with the `@Command` annotation. For example:

```java 
@Command(exitCodeOnInvalidInput = 123,
   exitCodeOnExecutionException = 456)
```

Additionally, applications can configure a `IExitCodeExceptionMapper` to map a specific exception to an exit code:

```java
class MyMapper implements IExitCodeExceptionMapper {
  public int getExitCode(Throwable t) {
    if (t instance of FileNotFoundException) {
      return 74;
    }
    return 1;
  }
}
```

When the end user specified invalid input, the `execute` method prints an error message followed by the usage help message of the command, and returns an exit code. This can be customized by configuring a `IParameterExceptionHandler`.

If the business logic of the command throws an exception, the `execute` method prints the stack trace of the exception and returns an exit code. This can be customized by configuring a `IExecutionExceptionHandler`.


#### Configuration
The new `CommandLine.execute` method is an instance method. The older `run`, `call` and `invoke` methods are static methods. Static methods don’t allow configuration. The new API lets applications configure the parser or other aspects before execution. For example:

```java
public static void main(String... args) {
  CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new App());
  cmd.setCaseInsensitiveEnumValuesAllowed(true);
  cmd.setUnmarchedArgumentsAllowed(true);
  cmd.setStopAtPositional(true);
  cmd.setExpandAtFiles(false);
  cmd.execute(args);
}
```

#### Execution Configuration

The following configuration methods are new and are only applicable with the `execute` method (and `executeHelpRequest`):

* get/setOut
* get/setErr
* get/setColorScheme
* get/setExecutionStrategy
* get/setParameterExceptionHandler
* get/setExecutionExceptionHandler
* get/setExitCodeExceptionMapper

The above methods are not applicable (and ignored) with other entry points like `parse`, `parseArgs`, `populateCommand`, `run`, `call`, `invoke`, `parseWithHandler` and `parseWithHandlers`.

#### API Evolution and Trade-offs

Previous versions of picocli offered the `run`, `call` and `invoke` methods to execute a `Runnable`, `Callable` or `Method` command. Here are some trade-offs versus the new `execute` method:

* *Static* - These are static methods, with the drawback that they don't allow configuration, as mentioned above.
* *Type Safety* - It is a compile-time error when an application tries to pass anything else than a `Runnable` to the `run` method, and a `Callable` to the `call` method. The `execute` method does not have this type safety, since the `CommandLine` constructor allows any `Object` as a parameter.
* *Return Value* - The `call` and `invoke` static methods allow commands to return _any_ value, while the `execute` method only returns an `int` exit code. From 4.0 the result object will be available from the `CommandLine.getExecutionResult` method. 

#### Feedback Requested

With the new execute API the `ColorScheme` class will start to play a more central role. I decided to make the `ColorScheme` class immutable from this release. This is a breaking API change. 
Should it be deprecated first, or not changed at all, or is the 4.0 release a good time to make breaking changes? Your feedback is very welcome on https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/675. 

### <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3-codegen"></a> Tools for Configuring GraalVM Native Image Builds

The `picocli-codegen` module now has two new tools, in addition to the existing `ReflectionConfigGenerator`:

* ResourceConfigGenerator
* DynamicProxyConfigGenerator

#### ResourceConfigGenerator
The GraalVM native-image builder by default will not integrate any of the
[classpath resources](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/RESOURCES.md) into the image it creates.

`ResourceConfigGenerator` generates a JSON String with the resource bundles and other classpath resources
that should be included in the Substrate VM native image.

The output of `ResourceConfigGenerator` is intended to be passed to the `-H:ResourceConfigurationFiles=/path/to/reflect-config.json` option of the `native-image` GraalVM utility,
or placed in a `META-INF/native-image/` subdirectory of the JAR. 

This allows picocli-based native image applications to access these resources.

#### DynamicProxyConfigGenerator

Substrate VM doesn't provide machinery for generating and interpreting bytecodes at run time. Therefore all dynamic proxy classes 
[need to be generated](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/DYNAMIC_PROXY.md) at native image build time.

`DynamicProxyConfigGenerator` generates a JSON String with the fully qualified interface names for which
dynamic proxy classes should be generated at native image build time.

The output of `DynamicProxyConfigGenerator` is intended to be passed to the `-H:DynamicProxyConfigurationFiles=/path/to/proxy-config.json` option of the `native-image` GraalVM utility,
or placed in a `META-INF/native-image/` subdirectory of the JAR.

This allows picocli-based native image applications that use `@Command`-annotated interfaces with
`@Option` and `@Parameters`-annotated methods.

## <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3-deprecated"></a> Deprecations

### Convenience Methods Replaced by `execute`
All variants of the `run`, `call`, `invoke`, and `parseWithHandlers` methods are deprecated from this release, in favor of the new `execute` method.

Similarly, the following classes and interfaces are deprecated:

* `IParseResultHandler2` is deprecated in favor of the new `IExecutionStrategy` interface.
* `IExceptionHandler2` is deprecated in favor of the new `IParameterExceptionHandler` `IExecutionExceptionHandler` interfaces.
* The `AbstractHandler` and `AbstractParseResultHandler` classes are deprecated with no replacement.

### Range
The public fields of the `Range` class have been deprecated and public methods `min()`, `max()`, `isVariable()` have been added that should be used instead.

## <a name="4.0.0-alpha-3-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

The `Help.ColorScheme` class has been made immutable. Its public fields are no longer public.
A new `Help.ColorScheme.Builder` class has been introduced to create `ColorScheme` instances.

This is a breaking API change: I could not think of a way to do this without breaking backwards compatibility.


# <a name="4.0.0-alpha-2"></a> Picocli 4.0.0-alpha-2
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 4.0.0-alpha-2.

Thanks to great feedback from the picocli community on the 4.0.0-alpha-1 release, this release contains many argument group-related bugfixes.
See the [4.0.0-alpha-1 New and Noteworthy section](#4.0.0-alpha-1-new) below for more details on argument groups.

_Please try this and provide feedback. We can still make changes._

_What do you think of the annotations API? What about the programmatic API? Does it work as expected? Are the input validation error messages correct and clear? Is the documentation clear and complete? Anything you want to change or improve? Any other feedback?_

This release also has support for variable expansion and improved support for Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

Many thanks to the picocli community for the contributions!

This is the fifty-third public release.

### Argument Groups

Many bugfixes for argument groups.

### Variable Interpolation

From this release, picocli supports variable interpolation (variable expansion) in annotation attributes as well as in text attributes of the programmatic API.

#### Variable Interpolation Example

```java
@Command(name = "status", description = "This command logs the status for ${PARENT-COMMAND-NAME}.")
class Status {
    @Option(names = {"${dirOptionName1:--d}", "${dirOptionName2:---directories}"}, // -d or --directories
            description = {"Specify one or more directories, separated by '${sys:path.separator}'.",
                           "The default is the user home directory (${DEFAULT-VALUE})."},  
            arity = "${sys:dirOptionArity:-1..*}",
            defaultValue = "${sys:user.home}",
            split = "${sys:path.separator}")
    String[] directories;
}
```

#### Predefined Variables

The following variables are predefined:

* `${DEFAULT-VALUE}`: (since 3.2) - can be used in the description for an option or positional parameter, replaced with the default value for that option or positional parameter
* `${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}`: (since 3.2) - can be used in the description for an option or positional parameter, replaced with the completion candidates for that option or positional parameter
* `${COMMAND-NAME}`: (since 4.0) - can be used in any section of the usage help message for a command, replaced with the name of the command
* `${COMMAND-FULL-NAME}`: (since 4.0) - can be used in any section of the usage help message for a command, replaced with the fully qualified name of the command (that is, preceded by its parent fully qualified name)
* `${PARENT-COMMAND-NAME}`: (since 4.0) - can be used in any section of the usage help message for a command, replaced with the name of its parent command
* `${PARENT-COMMAND-FULL-NAME}`: (since 4.0) - can be used in any section of the usage help message for a command, replaced with the fully qualified name of its parent command (that is, preceded by the name(s) of the parent command's ancestor commands)

#### Custom Variables

In addition, you can define your own variables. Currently the following syntaxes are supported:

* `${sys:key}`: system property lookup, replaced by the value of `System.getProperty("key")`
* `${env:key}`: environment variable lookup, replaced by the value of `System.getEnv("key")`
* `${bundle:key}`: look up the value of `key` in the resource bundle of the command
* `${key}`: search all of the above, first system properties, then environment variables, and finally the resource bundle of the command

#### Default Values for Custom Variables

You can specify a default value to use when no value is found for a custom variable. The syntax for specifying a default is `${a:-b}`, where `a` is the variable name and `b` is the default value to use if `a` is not found.

So, for the individual lookups, this looks like this:

```
${key:-defaultValue}
${sys:key:-defaultValue}
${env:key:-defaultValue}
${bundle:key:-defaultValue}
```

The default value may contain other custom variables. For example:

```
${bundle:a:-${env:b:-${sys:c:-X}}}
```

The above variable is expanded as follows. First, try to find key `a` in the command's resource bundle. If `a` is not found in the resource bundle, get the value of environment variable `b`. If no environment variable `b` exists, get the value of system property `c`. Finally, no system property `c` exists, the value of the expression becomes `X`.

#### Escaping Variables
Sometimes you want to show a string like `"${VAR}"` in a description.
A `$` character can be escaped with another `$` character. Therefore, `$${VAR}` will not be interpreted as a `VAR` variable, but will be replaced by `${VAR}` instead.

#### Switching Off Variable Interpolation

Variable interpolation can be switched off for the full command hierarchy by calling `CommandLine.setInterpolateVariables(false)`, or for a particular command by calling `CommandSpec.interpolateVariables(false)`.

#### Limitations of Variable Interpolation

Some attribute values need to be resolved early, when the model is constructed from the annotation values.

Specifically:

* command names and aliases, option names, mixin names
* `arity` (for options and positional parameters)
* `index` (for positional parameters)
* `separator` (for commands)

It is possible for these attributes to contain variables, but be aware of the limitations.

If these attributes have variables, and the variables get a different value after the model is constructed, the change will not be reflected in the model.



### Improved Support for Chinese, Japanese and Korean
Picocli will align the usage help message to fit within some user-defined width (80 columns by default).
A number of characters in Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are wider than others.
If those characters are treated to have the same width as other characters, the usage help message may extend past the right margin.

From this release, picocli will use 2 columns for these wide characters when calculating where to put line breaks, resulting in better usage help message text.

This can be switched off with `CommandLine.setAdjustLineBreaksForWideCJKCharacters(false)`.

* interactive options can now use type `char[]` instead of String, to allow applications to null out the array after use so that sensitive information is no longer resident in memory
* interactive options can be optionally interactive if configured with `arity = "0..1"`


For example, if an application has these options:

```java
@Option(names = "--user")
String user;

@Option(names = "--password", arity = "0..1", interactive = true)
char[] password;
```

With the following input, the `password` field will be initialized to `"123"` without prompting the user for input:

```
--password 123 --user Joe
```

However, if the password is not specified, the user will be prompted to enter a value. In the following example, the password option has no parameter, so the user will be prompted to type in a value on the console:

```
--password --user Joe
```

## <a name="4.0.0-alpha-1-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
### <a name="4.0.0-alpha-1-new-arggroups"></a> Argument Groups (Incubating)

This release introduces a new `@ArgGroup` annotation and its `ArgGroupSpec` programmatic equivalent.

Argument Groups can be used to define:

* mutually exclusive options
* options that must co-occur (dependent options)
* option sections in the usage help message
* repeating composite arguments

To create a group using the annotations API, annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup`.
The field's type refers to the class containing the options and positional parameters in the group.
(For annotated interface methods this would be the return type, for annotated setter methods in a concrete class this would be the setter's parameter type.)

Picocli will instantiate this class as necessary to capture command line argument values in the `@Option` and `@Parameters`-annotated fields and methods of this class.

#### Mutually Exclusive Options

Annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup(exclusive = true)` to create a group of mutually exclusive options and positional parameters. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "exclusivedemo")
public class MutuallyExclusiveOptionsDemo {

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = true, multiplicity = "1")
    Exclusive exclusive;

    static class Exclusive {
        @Option(names = "-a", required = true) int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", required = true) int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", required = true) int c;
    }
}
```

The above example defines a command with mutually exclusive options `-a`, `-b` and `-c`.

The group itself has a `multiplicity` attribute that defines how many times the group may be specified within the command.
The default is `multiplicity = "0..1"`, meaning that by default a group may be omitted or specified once.
In this example the group has `multiplicity = "1"`, so the group must occur once: one of the exclusive options must occur on the command line.

The synopsis of this command is `exclusivedemo (-a=<a> | -b=<b> | -c=<c>)`.

Note that the options are defined as `required = true`; this means required _within the group_, not required within the command.

Picocli will validate the arguments and throw a `MutuallyExclusiveArgsException` if multiple mutually exclusive arguments were specified. For example:

```java
MutuallyExclusiveOptionsDemo example = new MutuallyExclusiveOptionsDemo();
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(example);

try {
    cmd.parseArgs("-a=1", "-b=2");
} catch (MutuallyExclusiveArgsException ex) {
    assert "Error: -a=<a>, -b=<b> are mutually exclusive (specify only one)"
            .equals(ex.getMessage());
}
```

For the above group, only one of the options can be specified. Any other combination of options, or the absence of options, is invalid.

#### Co-occurring (Dependent) Options

Annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup(exclusive = false)` to create a group of dependent options and positional parameters that must co-occur. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "co-occur")
public class DependentOptionsDemo {

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = false)
    Dependent dependent;

    static class Dependent {
        @Option(names = "-a", required = true) int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", required = true) int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", required = true) int c;
    }
}
```

The above example defines a command with dependent options `-a`, `-b` and `-c` that must co-occur.

The group itself has a `multiplicity` attribute that defines how many times the group may be specified within the command.
In this example the group uses the default multiplicity, `multiplicity = "0..1"`, meaning that the group may be omitted or specified once.

The synopsis of this command is `co-occur [-a=<a> -b=<b> -c=<c>]`.

Note that the options are defined as `required = true`; this means required _within the group_, not required within the command.

Picocli will validate the arguments and throw a `MissingParameterException` if not all dependent arguments were specified. For example:

```java
DependentOptionsDemo example = new DependentOptionsDemo();
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(example);

try {
    cmd.parseArgs("-a=1", "-b=2");
} catch (MissingParameterException ex) {
    assert "Error: Missing required argument(s): -c=<c>".equals(ex.getMessage());
}
```

#### Option Sections in Usage Help

The example below uses groups to define options sections in the usage help.
When a group has a non-null `heading` (or `headingKey`), the options in the group are given the specified heading in the usage help message.
The `headingKey` attribute can be used to get the heading text from the command's resource bundle.

This works for mutually exclusive or co-occurring groups, but it is also possible to define a group that does no validation but only creates an option section in the usage help.

Annotate a field or method with `@ArgGroup(validate = false)` to create a group for display purposes only. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "sectiondemo", description = "Section demo")
public class OptionSectionDemo {

    @ArgGroup(validate = false, heading = "This is the first section%n")
    Section1 section1;

    static class Section1 {
        @Option(names = "-a", description = "Option A") int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", description = "Option B") int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", description = "Option C") int c;
    }

    @ArgGroup(validate = false, heading = "This is the second section%n")
    Section2 section2;

    static class Section2 {
        @Option(names = "-x", description = "Option X") int x;
        @Option(names = "-y", description = "Option Y") int y;
        @Option(names = "-z", description = "Option X") int z;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new CommandLine(new OptionSectionDemo()).usage(System.out);
    }
}
```

This prints the following usage help message:
```
Usage: sectiondemo [-a=<a>] [-b=<b>] [-c=<c>] [-x=<x>] [-y=<y>] [-z=<z>]
Section demo
This is the first section
  -a=<a>    Option A
  -b=<b>    Option B
  -c=<c>    Option C
This is the second section
  -x=<x>    Option X
  -y=<y>    Option Y
  -z=<z>    Option X
```

Note that the heading text must end with `%n` to insert a newline between the heading text and the first option.
This is for consistency with other headings in the usage help, like `@Command(headerHeading = "Usage:%n", optionListHeading = "%nOptions:%n")`.

#### Repeating Composite Argument Groups

The below example shows how groups can be composed of other groups, and how arrays and collections can be used to capture repeating groups (with a `multiplicity` greater than one):

```java
public class CompositeGroupDemo {

    @ArgGroup(exclusive = false, multiplicity = "1..*")
    List<Composite> composites;

    static class Composite {
        @ArgGroup(exclusive = false, multiplicity = "1")
        Dependent dependent;

        @ArgGroup(exclusive = true, multiplicity = "1")
        Exclusive exclusive;
    }

    static class Dependent {
        @Option(names = "-a", required = true) int a;
        @Option(names = "-b", required = true) int b;
        @Option(names = "-c", required = true) int c;
    }

    static class Exclusive {
        @Option(names = "-x", required = true) boolean x;
        @Option(names = "-y", required = true) boolean y;
        @Option(names = "-z", required = true) boolean z;
    }
}
```

In the above example, the annotated `composites` field defines a composite group that must be specified at least once, and may be specified many times, on the command line.
Each time the group is matched, picocli creates an instance of the `Composite` class and adds it to the `composites` list.

The `Composite` class itself contains two groups: a group of dependent options that must co-occur, and another group of mutually exclusive options.
Both of these subgroups have `multiplicity = "1"`, so they can occur exactly once for each multiple of the `Composite` group. The below example illustrates:

```java
CompositeGroupDemo example = new CompositeGroupDemo();
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(example);

cmd.parseArgs("-x", "-a=1", "-b=1", "-c=1", "-a=2", "-b=2", "-c=2", "-y");
assert example.composites.size() == 2;

Composite c1 = example.composites.get(0);
assert c1.exclusive.x;
assert c1.dependent.a == 1;
assert c1.dependent.b == 1;
assert c1.dependent.c == 1;

Composite c2 = example.composites.get(1);
assert c2.exclusive.y;
assert c2.dependent.a == 2;
assert c2.dependent.b == 2;
assert c2.dependent.c == 2;
```

#### Positional Parameters

When a `@Parameters` positional parameter is part of a group, its `index` is the index _within the group_, not within the command.


#### Limitations and Points of Caution

* Options with the same name cannot be defined in multiple groups. Similarly, it is not possible to define an option outside of a group with the same name as a different option that is part of a group.
* Positional parameters in a single group work fine, but take care (or avoid) defining positional parameters in multiple groups or positional parameters in a group as well as outside a group. Positional parameters are matched by index, and while the index of a group is reset when a new group multiple is encountered, the index of positional parameters outside a group only increases and is never reset.

# <a name="3.9.5"></a> Picocli 3.9.5
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.9.5.

This release contains a critical workaround to protect against JVM crashes when running on RedHat Linux 3.10.0-327.44.2.el7.x86_64.

Picocli 3.9.0 introduced a change in the heuristics for emitting ANSI escape characters. As part of this change, picocli may load the `org.fusesource.jansi.AnsiConsole` class from the JAnsi library when not running on Windows. This may crash the JVM (see [fusesource/jansi-native#17](https://github.com/fusesource/jansi-native/issues/17)).

The workaround in this release is to only load the `AnsiConsole` class when running on Windows.

Users using 3.9.0 and higher are strongly recommended to upgrade to 3.9.5 or later.


This is the fiftieth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.9.4.

This release contains bugfixes and enhancements.

From this release, `enum`-typed options and positional parameters that are multi-value can be stored in `EnumSet` collections (in addition to other Collections, arrays and Maps). 

Also, a better error message is now shown when unknown options are encountered while processing clustered short options. The new error message includes both the failing part and the original command line argument.

Bugfixes: 
* `ReflectionConfigGenerator` incorrectly listed superclass fields as fields of the concrete subclass, causing "GraalVM error: Error parsing reflection configuration in json" when creating a native image.
* Method subcommands in commands that subclass another command caused `InitializationException`.


This is the forty-ninth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="3.9.1-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes
The `picocli.AutoComplete` application no longer calls `System.exit()` unless requested by setting system property `picocli.autocomplete.systemExitOnError` or `picocli.autocomplete.systemExitOnSuccess` to any value other than `false`.
Applications that rely on the exit codes introduced in picocli 3.9.0 need to set these system properties.

The new support for quoted map keys with embedded '=' characters [#594] may inpact some existing applications.
If `CommandLine::setTrimQuotes()` is set to `true`, quotes are now removed from map keys and map values. This did not use to be the case.

For example:

```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "-p") Map<String, String> map;
}
```
When `CommandLine::setTrimQuotes()` was set to `true`, given input like the below:

```
-p AppOptions="-Da=b -Dx=y"
```
The above used to result in a map with key `AppOptions` and value `"-Da=b -Dx=y"` (including the quotes), but the same program and input now results in a map with key `AppOptions` and value `-Da=b -Dx=y` (without quotes). 

Also, when `CommandLine::setTrimQuotes()` is `false` (the default), input like the below will now cause a `ParameterException` ("value should be in KEY=VALUE format"):

```
-p "AppOptions=-Da=b -Dx=y"
```
Prior to this release, the above was silently ignored (no errors but also no key-value pairs in the resulting map).
 

# <a name="3.9.0"></a> Picocli 3.9.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.9.0.

This release contains bugfixes and enhancements in the main picocli module, and adds a new module: `picocli-shell-jline3`.

The new module Picocli Shell JLine3 (`picocli-shell-jline3`) contains components and documentation for building
interactive shell command line applications with JLine 3 and picocli.

This release contains API enhancements to allow customization of the usage help message:

* help section renderers can be added, replaced or removed
* help section keys to reorder sections in the usage help message
* help factory to create custom `Help` instances
* option order attribute to reorder options in the usage help message option list

This release also has improved heuristics to decide whether ANSI escape codes should be emitted or not.

The simplified @-file (argument file) format is now fully compatible with JCommander: empty lines are ignored and comments may start with leading whitespace.

The `picocli.Autocompletion` application now accepts a parameter specifying a custom factory, and returns a non-zero exit code on error, to facilitate incorporating it into the build.

Bug fixes in this release: 

* `@Command` method options and positional parameter values are now cleared correctly when reusing a `CommandLine` instance
* the default exception handler now correctly respects the exit code for all exceptions

Finally, this release improves internal quality and robustness by increasing the test code coverage. About 300 tests were added to bring the total to 1300+ tests. This improved line coverage to 98% (was 88%) and complexity coverage to 98% (was 82%).

This is the forty-fifth public release.

### <a name="3.9.0-helpsectionrenderer"></a> Help Section Renderer API

This release introduces new API to facilitate customizing the usage help message: `IHelpFactory` allows applications to plug in `Help` subclasses, and `IHelpSectionRenderer` allows applications to add custom sections to the usage help message, or redefine existing sections.

The usage help message is no longer hard-coded, but is now constructed from the section renderers defined in `CommandLine::getHelpSectionMap` (or `UsageMessageSpec::sectionMap` for a single `CommandSpec`).

By default this map contains the predefined section renderers:

```java
// The default section renderers delegate to methods in Help for their implementation
// (using Java 8 lambda notation for brevity):
Map<String, IHelpSectionRenderer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put(SECTION_KEY_HEADER_HEADING,         help -> help.headerHeading());
map.put(SECTION_KEY_HEADER,                 help -> help.header());

//e.g. Usage:
map.put(SECTION_KEY_SYNOPSIS_HEADING,       help -> help.synopsisHeading());

//e.g. <cmd> [OPTIONS] <subcmd> [COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]
map.put(SECTION_KEY_SYNOPSIS,               help -> help.synopsis(help.synopsisHeadingLength()));

//e.g. %nDescription:%n%n
map.put(SECTION_KEY_DESCRIPTION_HEADING,    help -> help.descriptionHeading());

//e.g. {"Converts foos to bars.", "Use options to control conversion mode."}
map.put(SECTION_KEY_DESCRIPTION,            help -> help.description());

//e.g. %nPositional parameters:%n%n
map.put(SECTION_KEY_PARAMETER_LIST_HEADING, help -> help.parameterListHeading());

//e.g. [FILE...] the files to convert
map.put(SECTION_KEY_PARAMETER_LIST,         help -> help.parameterList());

//e.g. %nOptions:%n%n
map.put(SECTION_KEY_OPTION_LIST_HEADING,    help -> help.optionListHeading());

//e.g. -h, --help   displays this help and exits
map.put(SECTION_KEY_OPTION_LIST,            help -> help.optionList());

//e.g. %nCommands:%n%n
map.put(SECTION_KEY_COMMAND_LIST_HEADING,   help -> help.commandListHeading());

//e.g.    add       adds the frup to the frooble
map.put(SECTION_KEY_COMMAND_LIST,           help -> help.commandList());
map.put(SECTION_KEY_FOOTER_HEADING,         help -> help.footerHeading());
map.put(SECTION_KEY_FOOTER,                 help -> help.footer());
```

Applications can add, remove or replace sections in this map. The `CommandLine::getHelpSectionKeys` method (or `UsageMessageSpec::sectionKeys` for a single `CommandSpec`) returns the section keys in the order that the usage help message should render the sections. The default keys are (in order):
1. SECTION_KEY_HEADER_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_HEADER
1. SECTION_KEY_SYNOPSIS_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_SYNOPSIS
1. SECTION_KEY_DESCRIPTION_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_DESCRIPTION
1. SECTION_KEY_PARAMETER_LIST_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_PARAMETER_LIST
1. SECTION_KEY_OPTION_LIST_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_OPTION_LIST
1. SECTION_KEY_COMMAND_LIST_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_COMMAND_LIST
1. SECTION_KEY_FOOTER_HEADING
1. SECTION_KEY_FOOTER

This ordering may be modified with the `CommandLine::setHelpSectionKeys` setter method (or `UsageMessageSpec::sectionKeys(List)` for a single `CommandSpec`).


### <a name="3.9.0-order"></a> Option `order` Attribute

Options are sorted alphabetically by default, but this can be switched off by specifying `@Command(sortOptions = false)` on the command declaration. This displays options in the order they are declared.

However, when mixing `@Option` methods and `@Option` fields, options do not reliably appear in declaration order.

The `@Option(order = <int>)` attribute can be used to explicitly control the position in the usage help message at which the option should be shown. Options with a lower number are shown before options with a higher number.


### <a name="3.9.0-picocli-shell-jline3"></a> New Module `picocli-shell-jline3`
Picocli Shell JLine3 contains components and documentation for building interactive shell command line applications with JLine 3 and picocli.

This release contains the `picocli.shell.jline3.PicocliJLineCompleter` class. 
`PicocliJLineCompleter` is a small component that generates completion candidates to allow users to get command line TAB auto-completion for a picocli-based application running in a JLine 3 shell.
It is similar to the class with the same name in the `picocli.shell.jline2` package in the `picocli-shell-jline2` module.

See the module's [README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/picocli-shell-jline3/README.md) for more details.

### <a name="3.9.0-ANSI-heuristics"></a> Improved ANSI Heuristics
This release has improved heuristics to decide whether ANSI escape codes should be emitted or not.

Support was added for the following environment variables to control enabling ANSI:

* [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/)
* [`CLICOLOR_FORCE`](https://bixense.com/clicolors/)
* [`CLICOLOR`](https://bixense.com/clicolors/)
* [`ConEmuANSI`](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#Environment_variable)
* [`ANSICON`](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/blob/master/readme.txt)

## <a name="3.8.1-new"></a> New and Noteworthy

### <a name="3.8.0-simplified-argument-files"></a> Simplified Argument Files

In this argument file format every line (except comment lines) is interpreted as a single argument. Arguments containing whitespace do not need to be quoted, but it is not possible to have arguments with embedded newlines.
 
Set system property `picocli.useSimplifiedAtFiles` without a value or with value `"true"` (case-insensitive) to enable this simpler argument file format.

This format is similar to the way JCommander processes argument files, which makes it easier for command line applications to migrate from JCommander to picocli.

### <a name="3.8.1-improved-tracing"></a> Improved Tracing

The following information has been added to the tracing output in this release:

* Version information (picocli version, java version, os version), logged at INFO level
* ANSI enabled status, logged at DEBUG level
* Log at DEBUG level when a Map or Collection binding for an option or positional parameter is initialized with a new instance
* Log at DEBUG level when parameters are being split (into how many parts, show resulting parts)

### <a name="3.8.0-command-method-mixins"></a> Mixin Support in `@Command` Methods

`@Command` methods now accept `@Mixin` parameters. All options and positional parameters defined in the mixin class are added to the command.

Example:

```java
class CommonParams {
    @Option(names = "-x") int x;
    @Option(names = "-y") int y;
}

class App {
    @Command
    public void doit(@Mixin CommonParams params, @Option(names = "-z") int z) {}
}
```

In the above example, the `-x` and `-y` options are added to the other options of the `doit` command.

### Help Layout

The usage help no longer shows a space between short option names and the parameter (for options that only have a short name).
This may break tests that rely on the exact output format.

Before:
```
Usage: times [-l=<arg0>] [-r=<arg1>]
  -l= <arg0>
  -r= <arg1>
```

After:
```
Usage: times [-l=<arg0>] [-r=<arg1>]
  -l=<arg0>
  -r=<arg1>
```

### Unmatched Primitive Wrapper Type Options

Another behavioral change is that command methods now pass in `null` for primitive wrapper options that were not matched on the command line.
This impacts methods annotated with `@Command`, and interface methods annotated with `@Option`. Classes annotated with `@Command` already behaved like this and this has not changed.

This behaviour is now consistent for all annotation-based and programmatic ways of defining commands.


# <a name="3.7.0"></a> Picocli 3.7.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.7.0.

### <a name="3.7.0-quoting"></a> Improved Parsing of Quoted Values
This release improves parser behaviour of quoted arguments:

* Quotes around command line parameters are now preserved by default (previously they were removed). This can be configured with `CommandLine::setTrimQuotes`.
* When [splitting](https://picocli.info/#_split_regex) parameters, quoted strings are no longer split. This can be configured with `CommandLine::setSplitQuotedStrings`.

Example:
```
@Option(names = "-x", split = ",")
String[] parts;
```

Given input like below:

```
<command> -x a,b,"c,d,e",f,"xxx,yyy"
```
This results in the `parts` array having the following values:
```
a
b
"c,d,e"
f
"xxx,yyy"
```

### <a name="3.7.0-picocli-codegen"></a> New Module `picocli-codegen`
Picocli Code Generation contains tools for generating source code, documentation and configuration files 
for picocli-based applications.

This release contains the `ReflectionConfigGenerator` class.
`ReflectionConfigGenerator` generates a JSON String with the program elements that will be accessed reflectively in a picocli-based application, in order to compile this application ahead-of-time into a native executable with GraalVM.

The output of `ReflectionConfigGenerator` is intended to be passed to the `-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=/path/to/reflectconfig` option of the `native-image` GraalVM utility. This allows picocli-based applications to be compiled to a native image.

See [Picocli on GraalVM: Blazingly Fast Command Line Apps](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/wiki/Picocli-on-GraalVM:-Blazingly-Fast-Command-Line-Apps) for details.

The module's [README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/picocli-codegen/README.md) explains how to configure your build to generate the configuration file automatically as part of your build.


### <a name="3.7.0-picocli-shell-jline2"></a> New Module `picocli-shell-jline2`
Picocli Shell JLine2 contains components and documentation for building
interactive shell command line applications with JLine 2 and picocli.

This release contains the `PicocliJLineCompleter` class.
`PicocliJLineCompleter` is a small component that generates completion candidates to allow users to
get command line TAB auto-completion for a picocli-based application running in a JLine 2 shell.

See the module's [README](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/picocli-shell-jline2/README.md) for more details.

## <a name="3.6.0"></a> Table of Contents
* [New and noteworthy](#3.6.0-new)
* [Fixed issues](#3.6.0-fixes)
* [Deprecations](#3.6.0-deprecated)
* [Potential breaking changes](#3.6.0-breaking-changes)

## <a name="3.6.0-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
### Default Provider

This release allows you to specify a default provider in the `@Command` annotation:

```java
@Command(defaultValueProvider = MyDefaultProvider.class)
class MyCommand // ...
```

The default provider allows you to get default values from a configuration file or some other central place.
Default providers need to implement the `picocli.CommandLine.IDefaultValueProvider` interface:

```java
public interface IDefaultValueProvider {

    /**
     * Returns the default value for an option or positional parameter or {@code null}.
     * The returned value is converted to the type of the option/positional parameter
     * via the same type converter used when populating this option/positional
     * parameter from a command line argument.
     *
     * @param argSpec the option or positional parameter, never {@code null}
     * @return the default value for the option or positional parameter, or {@code null} if
     *       this provider has no default value for the specified option or positional parameter
     * @throws Exception when there was a problem obtaining the default value
     */
    String defaultValue(ArgSpec argSpec) throws Exception;
}
```

### `@Command` Methods
From picocli 3.6, methods can be annotated with `@Command`. The method parameters provide the command options and parameters. For example:

```java
class Cat {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommandLine.invoke("cat", Cat.class, args);
    }

    @Command(description = "Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.",
             mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "3.6.0")
    void cat(@Option(names = {"-E", "--show-ends"}) boolean showEnds,
             @Option(names = {"-n", "--number"}) boolean number,
             @Option(names = {"-T", "--show-tabs"}) boolean showTabs,
             @Option(names = {"-v", "--show-nonprinting"}) boolean showNonPrinting,
             @Parameters(paramLabel = "FILE") File[] files) {
        // process files
    }
}
```
The usage help of the above command looks like this:

```
Usage: cat [-EhnTvV] [FILE...]
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.
      [FILE...]
  -E, --show-ends
  -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
  -n, --number
  -T, --show-tabs
  -v, --show-nonprinting
  -V, --version            Print version information and exit.
```
See below for an example that uses a resource bundle to define usage help descriptions outside the code.

For positional parameters, the `@Parameters` annotation may be omitted on method parameters.

TIP: If compiled with the `-parameters` flag on Java 8 or higher, the `paramLabel` of positional parameters is obtained from the method parameter name using reflection instead of the generic arg0, arg1, etc.

#### Subcommand Methods

If the enclosing class is annotated with `@Command`, method commands are added as subcommands to the class command, unless the class command has attribute `@Command(addMethodSubcommands = false)`.
For example:

```java
@Command(name = "git", mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "picocli-3.6.0")
class Git {
    @Option(names = "--git-dir", descriptionKey = "GITDIR")
    Path path;

    @Command
    void commit(@Option(names = {"-m", "--message"}) String commitMessage,
                @Option(names = "--squash", paramLabel = "<commit>") String squash,
                @Parameters(paramLabel = "<file>") File[] files) {
        // ... implement business logic
    }
}
```

Use `@Command(addMethodSubcommands = false)` on the class `@Command` annotation if the `@Command`-annotated methods in this class should not be added as subcommands.

The usage help of the `git commit` command looks like this:

```
Usage: git commit [--squash=<commit>] [-m=<arg0>] [<file>...]
      [<file>...]
      --squash=<commit>
  -m, --message=<arg0>
```


### Internationalization

From version 3.6, usage help message sections and the description for options and positional parameters can be specified in a resource bundle. A resource bundle can be set via annotations and programmatically.

Annotation example:

```java
@Command(name = "i18n-demo", resourceBundle = "my.org.I18nDemo_Messages")
class I18nDemo {}
```

Programmatic example:

```java
@Command class I18nDemo2 {}

CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new I18nDemo2());
cmd.setResourceBundle(ResourceBundle.getBundle("my.org.I18nDemo2_Messages"));
```


Resources for multiple commands can be specified in a single ResourceBundle. Keys and their value can be shared by multiple commands (so you don't need to repeat them for every command), but keys can be prefixed with `fully qualified command name + "."` to specify different values for different commands. The most specific key wins. 

This is especially convenient for `@Command` methods where long description annotations would make the code less easy to read. 

You can use a resource bundle to move the descriptions out of the code:

```
# shared between all commands
help = Show this help message and exit.
version = Print version information and exit.

# command-specific strings
git.usage.description = Version control system
git.GITDIR = Set the path to the repository

git.commit.usage.description = Record changes to the repository
git.commit.message = Use the given <msg> as the commit message.
git.commit.squash = Construct a commit message for use with rebase --autosquash.
git.commit.<file>[0..*] = The files to commit.
```

With this resource bundle, the usage help for the above `git commit` command looks like this:


```
Usage: git commit [--squash=<commit>] [-m=<arg0>] [<file>...]
Record changes to the repository
      [<file>...]         The files to commit.
      --squash=<commit>   Construct a commit message for use with rebase
                            --autosquash.
  -m, --message=<arg0>    Use the given <msg> as the commit message.
```

### Improved Error Messages

The error messages on invalid input have been improved. For example:

Previously, if an argument could not be converted to a primitive type, the error looked like this:

`Could not convert 'abc' to int for option '-num': java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"abc\"`

The new error message for primitive types looks like this:

`Invalid value for option '-num': 'abc' is not an int`

Previously, if an argument could not be converted to an enum, the error looked like this:

`Could not convert 'xyz' to TimeUnit for option '-timeUnit': java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.xyz`

The new error message for enums looks like this:

`Invalid value for option '-timeUnit': expected one of [NANOSECONDS, MILLISECONDS, MICROSECONDS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS] but was 'xyz'`

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.5.0.

This release contains new features, bugfixes and enhancements.

Password support: for options and positional parameters marked as `interactive`, the user is prompted to enter a value on the console.
When running on Java 6 or higher, picocli will use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Console.html#readPassword-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-"><code>Console.readPassword</code></a> API so that user input is not echoed to the console. 

Client code can now perform simple validation in annotated setter methods by throwing a `ParameterException` on invalid input. 

Also, from this release, the comment character in @-files (argument files) and the end-of-options delimiter (`--` by default) are configurable.

### <a name="3.5.0-passwords"></a><a name="3.5.0-interactive"></a> `Interactive` Options for Passwords or Passphrases
This release introduces password support: for options and positional parameters marked as `interactive`, the user is prompted to enter a value on the console.
When running on Java 6 or higher, picocli will use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Console.html#readPassword-java.lang.String-java.lang.Object...-"><code>Console.readPassword</code></a> API so that user input is not echoed to the console. 

Example usage:

```java
class Login implements Callable<Object> {
    @Option(names = {"-u", "--user"}, description = "User name")
    String user;

    @Option(names = {"-p", "--password"}, description = "Passphrase", interactive = true)
    String password;

    public Object call() throws Exception {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        md.update(password.getBytes());
        System.out.printf("Hi %s, your passphrase is hashed to %s.%n", user, base64(md.digest()));
        return null;
    }
    
    private String base64(byte[] arr) { /* ... */ }
}
```

When this command is invoked like this:

```java
CommandLine.call(new Login(), "-u", "user123", "-p");
```

Then the user will be prompted to enter a value:

```
Enter value for --password (Passphrase): 
```

When running on Java 6 or higher, the user input is not echoed to the console.
After the user enters a value and presses enter, the `call()` method is invoked, which prints the following:

```bash
Hi user123, your passphrase is hashed to 75K3eLr+dx6JJFuJ7LwIpEpOFmwGZZkRiB84PURz6U8=.
```

### <a name="3.5.0-validation"></a> Simple Validation in Setter Methods
Methods annotated with `@Option` and `@Parameters` can do simple input validation by throwing a `ParameterException` when invalid values are specified on the command line.

```java
class ValidationExample {
    private Map<String, String> properties = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    
    @Spec private CommandSpec spec; // injected by picocli
    
    @Option(names = {"-D", "--property"}, paramLabel = "KEY=VALUE")
    public void setProperty(Map<String, String> map) {
        for (String key : map.keySet()) {
            String newValue = map.get(key);
            validateUnique(key, newValue);
            properties.put(key, newValue);
        }
    }

    private void validateUnique(String key, String newValue) {
        String existing = properties.get(key);
        if (existing != null && !existing.equals(newValue)) {
            throw new ParameterException(spec.commandLine(),
                    String.format("Duplicate key '%s' for values '%s' and '%s'.",
                    key, existing, newValue));
        }
    }
}
```

Prior to this release, the exception thrown from the method was wrapped in a `java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException`, which in turn was wrapped in a `PicocliException`, and finally in another `ParameterException`.

By following the recipe above and throwing a `ParameterException` on invalid input, all these intermediate exceptions are skipped.

The parser can now ignore case when parsing arguments for an Enum option or positional parameter.
New methods `Help.Ansi.text(String)` and `Help.Ansi.string(String)` assist client code in easily creating ANSI messages outside usage help and version help.

This is the thirty-fifth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### `UnmatchedArgumentException` Improvements
The `UnmatchedArgumentException` class now has several methods that allow an application to offer suggestions for fixes to the end user.

For example:
```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "--file") File[] files;
    @Option(names = "--find") String pattern;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        App app = new App();
        try {
            new CommandLine(app).parse(args);
            // ...
            
        } catch (ParameterException ex) {
            System.err.println(ex.getMessage());
            if (!UnmatchedArgumentException.printSuggestions(ex, System.err)) { // new API
                ex.getCommandLine().usage(System.err, ansi);
            }
        }
    } 
}
```

If you run this class with an invalid option that is similar to an actual option, the `UnmatchedArgumentException.printSuggestions` method will show the actual options. For example:

```
<cmd> -fi
```

Prints this output:

```
Unknown option: -fi
Possible solutions: --file, --find
```

This is the behaviour for the `CommandLine` convenience methods `run`, `call` and `parseWithHandlers`. 
Note that if possible fixes are found, the usage help message is not displayed.

# <a name="3.2.0"></a> Picocli 3.2.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.2.0.

This release contains new features and enhancements:

* Improved support for Dependency Injection
* Methods can now be annotated with `@Option` and `@Parameters`
* Support for JLine-based interactive command line interfaces (`completionCandidates` attribute on `@Option` and `@Parameters`, and the `AutoComplete.complete` method)
* New `@Spec` annotation for injecting a command with its `CommandSpec`

This is the thirty-third public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### <a name="3.2.0-di"></a> Dependency Injection
This release makes integration with Dependency Injection containers extremely easy:

* `CommandLine` constructor now accepts a `Class` instance as the user object, and will delegate to the `IFactory` to get an instance.
* New `CommandLine.run(Class<Runnable>, IFactory, ...)` and `CommandLine.call(Class<Callable>, IFactory, ...)` methods. These work the same as the existing `run` and `call` methods except that the `Runnable` or `Callable` instance is created by the factory.

The below example shows how to create an `IFactory` implementation with a Guice `Injector`:

```java
import com.google.inject.*;
import picocli.CommandLine.IFactory;

public class GuiceFactory implements IFactory {
    private final Injector injector = Guice.createInjector(new DemoModule());

    @Override
    public <K> K create(Class<K> aClass) throws Exception {
        return injector.getInstance(aClass);
    }

    static class DemoModule extends AbstractModule {
        @Override
        protected void configure() {
            bind(java.util.List.class).to(java.util.LinkedList.class);
            bind(Runnable.class).to(InjectionDemo.class);
        }
    }
}
```


Use the custom factory when creating a `CommandLine` instance, or when invoking the `run` or `call` convenience methods:

```java
import javax.inject.Inject;

@Command(name = "di-demo")
public class InjectionDemo implements Runnable {
    @Inject java.util.List list;

    @Option(names = "-x") int x;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommandLine.run(Runnable.class, new GuiceFactory(), args);
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        assert list instanceof java.util.LinkedList;
    }
}
```


### <a name="3.2.0-method-annotations"></a> Annotated Methods
From this release, `@Option` and `@Parameter` annotations can be added to methods as well as fields of a class.

For concrete classes, annotate "setter" methods (methods that accept a parameter) and when the option is specified on the command line, picocli will invoke the method with the value specified on the command line, converted to the type of the method parameter.

Alternatively, you may annotate "getter-like" methods (methods that return a value) on an interface, and picocli will create an instance of the interface that returns the values specified on the command line, converted to the method return type. This feature is inspired by [Jewel CLI](https://github.com/lexicalscope/jewelcli).

#### Annotating Methods of an Interface
The `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations can be used on methods of an interface that return a value. For example:

```java
interface Counter {
    @Option(names = "--count")
    int getCount();
}
```
You use it by specifying the class of the interface:
```java
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(Counter.class); // specify a class
String[] args = new String[] {"--count", "3"};
cmd.parse(args);
Counter counter = cmd.getCommand(); // picocli created an instance
assert counter.getCount() == 3; // method returns command line value
```

#### Annotating Methods of a Concrete Class
The `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations can be used on methods of a class that accept a parameter. For example:

```java
class Counter {
    int count;
    
    @Option(names = "--count")
    void setCount(int count) {
        this.count = count;
    }
}
```
You use it by passing an instance of the class:
```java
Counter counter = new Counter(); // the instance to populate
CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(counter);
String[] args = new String[] {"--count", "3"};
cmd.parse(args);
assert counter.count == 3; // method was invoked with command line value
```

### <a name="3.2.0-jline"></a> JLine Tab-Completion Support

This release adds support for JLine Tab-Completion.

[Jline 2.x](https://github.com/jline/jline2) and [3.x](https://github.com/jline/jline3) is a Java library for handling console input, often used to create interactive shell applications.

Command line applications based on picocli can generate completion candidates for the command line in the JLine shell. The generated completion candidates are context sensitive, so once a subcommand is specified, only the options for that subcommand are shown, and once an option is specified, only parameters for that option are shown.

Below is an example picocli `Completer` implementation for JLine 2.x:

```java
import jline.console.completer.ArgumentCompleter;
import jline.console.completer.Completer;
import picocli.AutoComplete;
import picocli.CommandLine;
import picocli.CommandLine.Model.CommandSpec;

import java.util.List;

public class PicocliJLineCompleter implements Completer {
    private final CommandSpec spec;

    public PicocliJLineCompleter(CommandSpec spec) {
        this.spec = spec;
    }

    @Override
    public int complete(String buffer, int cursor, List<CharSequence> candidates) {
        // use the jline internal parser to split the line into tokens
        ArgumentCompleter.ArgumentList list =
                new ArgumentCompleter.WhitespaceArgumentDelimiter().delimit(buffer, cursor);

        // let picocli generate completion candidates for the token where the cursor is at
        return AutoComplete.complete(spec,
                list.getArguments(),
                list.getCursorArgumentIndex(),
                list.getArgumentPosition(),
                cursor,
                candidates);
    }
}
```

### <a name="3.2.0-completion-candidates"></a> Completion Candidates
From this release, `@Options` and `@Parameters` have a new `completionCandidates` attribute that can be used to generate a list of completions for this option or positional parameter. For example:

```java
static class MyAbcCandidates extends ArrayList<String> {
    MyAbcCandidates() { super(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C")); }
}

class ValidValuesDemo {
    @Option(names = "-o", completionCandidates = MyAbcCandidates.class)
    String option;
}
```

This will generate completion option values `A`, `B` and `C` in the generated bash auto-completion script and in JLine.


### <a name="3.2.0-default-variable"></a> `${DEFAULT-VALUE}` Variable
From picocli 3.2, it is possible to embed the default values in the description for an option or positional parameter by
specifying the variable `${DEFAULT-VALUE}` in the description text.
Picocli uses reflection to get the default values from the annotated fields.

The variable is replaced with the default value regardless of the `@Command(showDefaultValues)` attribute
and regardless of the `@Option(showDefaultValues)` or `@Parameters(showDefaultValues)` attribute.

```java
class DefaultValues {
    @Option(names = {"-f", "--file"},
            description = "the file to use (default: ${DEFAULT-VALUE})")
    File file = new File("config.xml");
}

CommandLine.usage(new DefaultValues(), System.out);
```
This produces the following usage help:
```text
Usage: <main class> -f=<file>
  -f, --file=<file>   the file to use (default: config.xml)
```

### <a name="3.2.0-completion-variable"></a>  `${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}` Variable
Similarly, it is possible to embed the completion candidates in the description for an option or positional parameter by
specifying the variable `${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}` in the description text.

This works for java `enum` classes and for options or positional parameters of non-enum types for which completion candidates are specified.

```java
enum Lang { java, groovy, kotlin, javascript, frege, clojure }

static class MyAbcCandidates extends ArrayList<String> {
    MyAbcCandidates() { super(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C")); }
}

class ValidValuesDemo {
    @Option(names = "-l", description = "Enum. Values: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}")
    Lang lang = null;

    @Option(names = "-o", completionCandidates = MyAbcCandidates.class,
            description = "Candidates: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}")
    String option;
}

CommandLine.usage(new ValidValuesDemo(), System.out);
```
This produces the following usage help:
```text
Usage: <main class> -l=<lang> -o=<option>
  -l=<lang>     Enum. Values: java, groovy, kotlin, javascript, frege, clojure
  -o=<option>   Candidates: A, B, C
```

### <a name="3.2.0-Spec"></a> `@Spec` Annotation  
A new `@Spec` annotation is now available that injects the `CommandSpec` model of the command into a command field.

This is useful when a command needs to use the picocli API, for example to walk the command hierarchy and iterate over its sibling commands.
This complements the `@ParentCommand` annotation;  the `@ParentCommand` annotation injects a user-defined command object, whereas this annotation injects a picocli class.
  
```java
class InjectSpecExample implements Runnable {
   @Spec CommandSpec commandSpec;
   //...
   public void run() {
       // do something with the injected spec
   }
}
  
```  
  
  
  

### <a name="3.2.0-lenient-parse"></a> Lenient Parse Mode

This release adds the ability to continue parsing invalid input to the end.
When `collectErrors` is set to `true`, and a problem occurs during parsing, an `Exception` is added to the `ParseResult.errors()` list and parsing continues. The default behaviour (when `collectErrors` is `false`) is to abort parsing by throwing the `Exception`.

This is useful when generating completion candidates on partial input, and is also useful when using picocli in
languages like Clojure where idiomatic error handling does not involve throwing and catching exceptions.

When using this feature, applications are responsible for actively verifying that no errors occurred before executing the business logic. Use with care!

## <a name="3.0.1-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
From this release, the usage help synopsis of the subcommand shows not only the subcommand name but also the parent command name. For example, take the following hierarchy of subcommands.

```java
@Command(name = "main", subcommands = {Sub.class}) class App { }
@Command(name = "sub", subcommands = {SubSub.class}) class Sub { }
@Command(name = "subsub", mixinStandardHelpOptions = true) class SubSub { }

CommandLine parser = new CommandLine(new App());
ParseResult result = parser.parseArgs("sub", "subsub", "--help");
CommandLine.printHelpIfRequested(result);
```
The above code prints the usage help for the `subsub` nested subcommand. Notice that this shows not only the subcommand name but the full command hierarchy:

```
Usage: main sub subsub [-hV]
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
```

# <a name="3.0.0"></a> Picocli 3.0.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.0.0.

This release offers a [programmatic API](http://picocli.info/picocli-3.0-programmatic-api.html) for creating command line applications, in addition to the annotations API. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages. The picocli community is proud to announce that [Apache Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)'s [CliBuilder](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/gapi/groovy/cli/picocli/CliBuilder.html) DSL for command line applications has been rewritten to use the picocli programmatic API, starting from Groovy 2.5.

Another new feature in this release are Mixins. Mixins allow reusing common options, parameters and command attributes in multiple applications without copy-and-paste duplication.

This release aims to reduce boilerplate code in user applications even further with the new `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. Picocli adds standard `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to commands with this attribute. Additionally picocli now offers a `HelpCommand` that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands.

From this release, picocli is better at following unix conventions: by default it now prints to stdout when the user requested help, and prints to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred. This release also gives better control over the process exit code.

A new `@Unmatched` annotation allows applications to easily capture unmatched arguments (arguments that could not be matched with any of the registered options or positional parameters).

Usage help message improvements: the usage help message width is now configurable, and the message layout is improved to reduce horizontal padding. Furthermore, you can now specify for individual options or positional parameters whether their default value should be shown in the description or hidden.

Finally, this release adds several options to configure parser behaviour. Picocli can now be configured to function like Apache Commons CLI, to facilitate migration from Apache Commons CLI to picocli.


This is the twenty-ninth public release.

### <a name="3.0.0-Programmatic-API"></a> Programmatic API
This release offers a programmatic API for creating command line applications, in addition to the annotations API. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages. (Example: Groovy [CliBuilder](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/next/html/gapi/groovy/cli/picocli/CliBuilder.html).)

_If you have suggestions for improving the programmatic API, please raise a ticket on GitHub!_

#### Example
```java
CommandSpec spec = CommandSpec.create();
spec.mixinStandardHelpOptions(true); // --help and --version options
spec.addOption(OptionSpec.builder("-c", "--count")
        .paramLabel("COUNT")
        .type(int.class)
        .description("number of times to execute").build());

#### CommandSpec
`CommandSpec` models a command. It is the programmatic variant of the `@Command` annotation. It has a name and a version, both of which may be empty.  It also has a `UsageMessageSpec` to configure aspects of the usage help message and a `ParserSpec` that can be used to control the behaviour of the parser.

#### OptionSpec and PositionalParamSpec
`OptionSpec` models a named option, and `PositionalParamSpec` models one or more positional parameters. They are the programmatic variant of the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations, respectively.

An `OptionSpec` must have at least one name, which is used during parsing to match command line arguments. Other attributes can be left empty and picocli will give them a reasonable default value. This defaulting is why `OptionSpec` objects are created with a builder: this allows you to specify only some attributes and let picocli initialise the other attributes. For example, if only the option’s name is specified, picocli assumes the option takes no parameters (arity = 0), and is of type `boolean`. Another example, if arity is larger than `1`, picocli sets the type to `List` and the `auxiliary type` to `String`.

`PositionalParamSpec` objects don’t have names, but have an index range instead. A single `PositionalParamSpec` object can capture multiple positional parameters. The default index range is set to `0..*` (all indices). A command may have multiple `PositionalParamSpec` objects to capture positional parameters at different index ranges. This can be useful if positional parameters at different index ranges have different data types.

Similar to `OptionSpec` objects, Once a `PositionalParamSpec` is constructed, its configuration becomes immutable, but its `value` can still be modified. Usually the value is set during command line parsing when a non-option command line argument is encountered at a position in its index range.

#### <a name="3.0.0-ParseResult"></a> ParseResult
A `ParseResult` class is now available that allows applications to inspect the result of parsing a sequence of command line arguments.

This class provides methods to query whether the command line arguments included certain options or position parameters, and what the value or values of these options and positional parameters was. Both the original command line argument String value as well as a strongly typed value can be obtained.


### Mixins for Reuse
Mixins are a convenient alternative to subclassing: picocli annotations from _any_ class can be added to ("mixed in" with) another command. This includes options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes. Picocli [autoHelp](#3.0.0-alpha-1-autohelp) internally uses a mixin.

A mixin is a separate class with options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes that can be reused in other commands. Mixins can be installed by calling the `CommandLine.addMixin` method with an object of this class, or annotating a field in your command with `@Mixin`. Here is an example mixin class:

```java
public class ReusableOptions {

    @Option(names = { "-v", "--verbose" }, description = {
        "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.", "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`" })
    protected boolean[] verbosity = new boolean[0];
}
```

#### Adding Mixins Programmatically
The below example shows how a mixin can be added programmatically with the `CommandLine.addMixin` method.

```java
CommandLine commandLine = new CommandLine(new MyCommand());
commandline.addMixin("myMixin", new ReusableOptions());
```
#### `@Mixin` Annotation
A command can also include mixins by annotating fields with `@Mixin`. All picocli annotations found in the mixin class are added to the command that has a field annotated with `@Mixin`. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "zip", description = "Example reuse with @Mixin annotation.")
public class MyCommand {

    // adds the options defined in ReusableOptions to this command
    @Mixin
    private ReusableOptions myMixin;
}
```


### <a name="3.0.0-mixinStandardHelpOptions"></a> Standard Help Options
This release introduces the `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. When this attribute is set to `true`, picocli adds a mixin to the command that adds `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to the command. For example:

```java
@Command(mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "auto help demo - picocli 3.0")
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```

Commands with `mixinStandardHelpOptions` do not need to explicitly declare fields annotated with `@Option(usageHelp = true)` and `@Option(versionHelp = true)` any more. The usage help message for the above example looks like this:
```text
Usage: <main class> [-hV] [--option=<option>]
      --option=<option>   Some option.
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.
```

### <a name="3.0.0-HelpCommand"></a> Help Command

From this release, picocli provides a `help` subcommand (`picocli.CommandLine.HelpCommand`) that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands. For example:

```java
@Command(subcommands = HelpCommand.class)
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```


```text
# print help for the `maincommand` command
maincommand help

# print help for the `subcommand` command
maincommand help subcommand
```

For applications that want to create a custom help command, this release also introduces a new interface `picocli.CommandLine.IHelpCommandInitializable` that provides custom help commands with the information they need: access to the parent command and sibling commands, whether to use Ansi colors or not, and the streams to print the usage help message to.

### <a name="3.0.0-Unmatched"></a> `@Unmatched` Annotation
Unmatched arguments are the command line arguments that could not be assigned to any of the defined options or positional parameters. From this release, fields annotated with `@Unmatched` will be populated with the unmatched arguments. The field must be of type `String[]` or `List<String>`.

If picocli finds a field annotated with `@Unmatched`, it automatically sets `unmatchedArgumentsAllowed` to `true` so no `UnmatchedArgumentException` is thrown when a command line argument cannot be assigned to an option or positional parameter.

### <a name="3.0.0-std"></a> Stdout or Stderr
From picocli v3.0, the `run` and `call` convenience methods follow unix conventions: print to stdout when the user requested help, and print to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred.

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to facilitate following this convention. `AbstractHandler` also provides `useOut` and `useErr` methods to allow customizing the target output streams, and `useAnsi` to customize the Ansi style to use:

```java
@Command class CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { ... }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo());

        PrintStream myOut = getOutputPrintStream(); // custom stream to send command output to
        PrintStream myErr = getErrorPrintStream();  // custom stream for error messages

        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().useOut(myOut).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.ON),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().useErr(myErr).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.OFF),
                args);
    }
}
```

### <a name="3.0.0-exit-code"></a> Exit Code Support
From picocli v3.0, the built-in parse result handlers (`RunFirst`, `RunLast` and `RunAll`) and exception handler (`DefaultExceptionHandler`) can specify an exit code. If an exit code was specified, the handler terminates the JVM with the specified status code when finished.

```java
@Command class ExitCodeDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { throw new ParameterException(new CommandLine(this), "exit code demo"); }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new ExitCodeDemo());
        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().andExit(123),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().andExit(456),
                args);
    }
}
```
Running this command prints the following to stderr and exits the JVM with status code `456`.

```
exit code demo
Usage: <main class>
```

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to inherit this behaviour.


### <a name="3.0.0-ShowDefault"></a> Fine-grained ShowDefault

This release adds a `showDefaultValue` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotation. This allows you to specify for each individual option and positional parameter whether its default value should be shown in the usage help.

This attribute accepts three values:

* `ALWAYS` - always display the default value of this option or positional parameter, even `null` values, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `NEVER` - don't show the default value for this option or positional parameter, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `ON_DEMAND` - (this is the default) only show the default value for this option or positional parameter if `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command

The `NEVER` value is useful for security sensitive command line arguments like passwords. The `ALWAYS` value is useful when you only want to show the default value for a few arguments but not for all (in combination with `@Command(showDefaultValues = false)`).

### <a name="3.0.0-UsageHelpLayout"></a> Improved Usage Help Message Layout
Previously, the usage message layout had a fixed width long option name column: this column is always 24 characters, even if none of the options have a long option name.

This gave strange-looking usage help messages in some cases. For example:
```java
@Command(name="ls")
class App {
    @Option(names = "-a", description = "display all files") boolean a;
    @Option(names = "-l", description = "use a long listing format") boolean l;
    @Option(names = "-t", description = "sort by modification time") boolean t;
}
```

The usage message for this example was:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a                          display all files
  -l                          use a long listing format
  -t                          sort by modification time
```
From this release, picocli adjusts the width of the long option name column to the longest name (up to max 24).

The new usage message for this example looks like this:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a     display all files
  -l     use a long listing format
  -t     sort by modification time
```

### <a name="3.0.0-StricterArity"></a> Stricter Arity Validation

Until this release, options with mandatory parameters would consume as many arguments as required, even if those arguments matched other option flags. For example:

Given a command like this:
```java
class App {
  @Option(names = "-a", arity = "2")
  String[] a;
  
  @Option(names = "-v")
  boolean v;
}
```
Prior to this change, the following input would be accepted:
```
<command> -a 1 -v
```
In previous versions, picocli accepted this and assigned `"1"` and `"-v"` as the two values for the `-a` option.
From this release, the parser notices that one of the arguments is an option and throws a `MissingParameterException` because not enough parameters were specified for the first option.

## <a name="3.0.0-beta-2-new"></a> New and Noteworthy

### Stricter Arity Validation

Until this release, options with mandatory parameters would consume as many arguments as required, even if those arguments matched other option flags. For example:

Given a command like this:
```java
class App {
  @Option(names = "-a", arity = "2")
  String[] a;
  
  @Option(names = "-v")
  boolean v;
}
```
Prior to this change, the following input would be accepted:
```
<command> -a 1 -v
```
In previous versions, picocli accepted this and assigned `"1"` and `"-v"` as the two values for the `-a` option.
From this release, the parser notices that one of the arguments is an option and throws a `MissingParameterException` because not enough parameters were specified for the first option.

## <a name="3.0.0-beta-1-new"></a> New and Noteworthy
Previously, the usage message layout had a fixed width long option name column: this column is always 24 characters, even if none of the options have a long option name.

This gives weird-looking usage help messages in some cases. For example:
```java
@Command(name="ls")
class App {
    @Option(names = "-a", description = "display all files") boolean a;
    @Option(names = "-l", description = "use a long listing format") boolean l;
    @Option(names = "-t", description = "sort by modification time") boolean t;
}
```

The usage message for this example was:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a                          display all files
  -l                          use a long listing format
  -t                          sort by modification time
```
From this release, picocli adjusts the width of the long option name column to the longest name (max 24).

The new usage message for this example looks like this:
```
Usage: ls [-alt]
  -a     display all files
  -l     use a long listing format
  -t     sort by modification time
```

### Max Arity Is Max Total Params

This release introduces a `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` parser configuration option.

By default, the arity of an option is the number of arguments _for each occurrence_ of the option.
For example, if option `-a` has `arity = "2"`, then the following is a perfectly valid command:
for each occurrence of the option, two option parameters are specified.
```bash
<command> -a 1 2 -a 3 4 -a 5 6
```
However, if `CommandLine.setMaxArityIsMaxTotalParams(true)` is called first, the above example would result in a `MaxValuesExceededException` because the total number of values (6) exceeds the arity of 2.

Additionally, by default, when `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` is `false`, arity is only applied _before_ the argument is split into parts,
while when `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` is set to `true`, validation is applied _after_ a command line argument has been split into parts.

For example, if we have an option like this:
```java
@Option(name = "-a", arity = "1..2", split = ",") String[] values;
```
By default, the following input would be a valid command:
```bash
<command> -a 1,2,3
```
By default, the option arity tells the parser to consume 1 to 2 arguments, and the option was followed by a single parameter, `"1,2,3"`, which is fine.

However, if `maxArityIsMaxTotalParams` is set to true, the above example would result in a `MaxValuesExceededException` because the argument is split into 3 parts, which exceeds the max arity of 2.

# <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1"></a> Picocli 3.0.0-alpha-1
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 3.0.0-alpha-1.

This release offers a programmatic API for creating command line applications, in addition to annotations. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages.

Another new feature in this release are Mixins. Mixins allow reusing common options, parameters and command attributes in multiple applications without copy-and-paste duplication.

Third, this release aims to reduce boilerplate code in user applications even further with the new `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. Picocli adds standard `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to commands with this attribute. Additionally picocli now offers a `HelpCommand` that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands.

From this release, picocli is better at following unix conventions: print to stdout when the user requested help, and print to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred.

Also, this release gives better control over the process exit code.

Additionally, fields annotated with `@Unmatched` will be populated with the unmatched arguments.

Furthermore, this release adds a `showDefaultValue` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotation.

This is the twenty-first public release.

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-Programmatic-API"></a> Programmatic API (INCUBATING)
This release offers a programmatic API for creating command line applications, in addition to annotations. The programmatic API allows applications to dynamically create command line options on the fly, and also makes it possible to create idiomatic domain-specific languages for processing command line arguments, using picocli, in other JVM languages.

Note that the programmatic API is incubating and the API may change in subsequent releases. _If you have suggestions for improving the programmatic API, please raise a ticket on GitHub!_

#### Example
```java
CommandSpec spec = CommandSpec.create();
spec.mixinStandardHelpOptions(true); // usageHelp and versionHelp options
spec.addOption(OptionSpec.builder("-c", "--count")
        .paramLabel("COUNT")
        .type(int.class)
        .description("number of times to execute").build());
spec.addPositional(PositionalParamSpec.builder()
        .paramLabel("FILES")
        .type(List.class)
        .auxiliaryTypes(File.class) // List<File>
        .description("The files to process").build());
CommandLine commandLine = new CommandLine(spec);

commandLine.parseWithSimpleHandlers(new AbstractSimpleParseResultHandler() {
    public void handle(ParseResult pr) {
        int count = pr.optionValue('c', 1);
        List<File> files = pr.positionalValue(0, Collections.<File>emptyList());
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            for (File f : files) {
                System.out.printf("%d: %s%n", i, f);
            }
        }
    }
}, args);
```

#### CommandSpec (INCUBATING)
`CommandSpec` models a command. It is the programmatic variant of the `@Command` annotation. It has a name and a version, both of which may be empty.  It also has a `UsageMessageSpec` to configure aspects of the usage help message and a `ParserSpec` that can be used to control the behaviour of the parser.

#### OptionSpec and PositionalParamSpec (INCUBATING)
`OptionSpec` models a named option, and `PositionalParamSpec` models one or more positional parameters. They are the programmatic variant of the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotations, respectively.

An `OptionSpec` must have at least one name, which is used during parsing to match command line arguments. Other attributes can be left empty and picocli will give them a reasonable default value. This defaulting is why `OptionSpec` objects are created with a builder: this allows you to specify only some attributes and let picocli initialise the other attributes. For example, if only the option’s name is specified, picocli assumes the option takes no parameters (arity = 0), and is of type `boolean`. Another example, if arity is larger than `1`, picocli sets the type to `List` and the `auxiliary type` to `String`.

`PositionalParamSpec` objects don’t have names, but have an index range instead. A single `PositionalParamSpec` object can capture multiple positional parameters. The default index range is set to `0..*` (all indices). A command may have multiple `PositionalParamSpec` objects to capture positional parameters at different index ranges. This can be useful if positional parameters at different index ranges have different data types.

Similar to `OptionSpec` objects, Once a `PositionalParamSpec` is constructed, its configuration becomes immutable, but its `value` can still be modified. Usually the value is set during command line parsing when a non-option command line argument is encountered at a position in its index range.

#### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-ParseResult"></a> ParseResult (INCUBATING)
A `ParseResult` class is now available that allows applications to inspect the result of parsing a sequence of command line arguments.

This class provides methods to query whether the command line arguments included certain options or position parameters, and what the value or values of these options and positional parameters was. Both the original command line argument String value as well as a strongly typed value can be obtained.


### Mixins for Reuse
Mixins are a convenient alternative to subclassing: picocli annotations from _any_ class can be added to ("mixed in" with) another command. This includes options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes. Picocli [autoHelp](#3.0.0-alpha-1-autohelp) internally uses a mixin.

A mixin is a separate class with options, positional parameters, subcommands and command attributes that can be reused in other commands. Mixins can be installed by calling the `CommandLine.addMixin` method with an object of this class, or annotating a field in your command with `@Mixin`. Here is an example mixin class:

```java
public class ReusableOptions {

    @Option(names = { "-v", "--verbose" }, description = {
        "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.", "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`" })
    protected boolean[] verbosity = new boolean[0];
}
```

#### Adding Mixins Programmatically
The below example shows how a mixin can be added programmatically with the `CommandLine.addMixin` method.

```java
CommandLine commandLine = new CommandLine(new MyCommand());
commandline.addMixin("myMixin", new ReusableOptions());
```
#### `@Mixin` Annotation
A command can also include mixins by annotating fields with `@Mixin`. All picocli annotations found in the mixin class
are added to the command that has a field annotated with `@Mixin`. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "zip", description = "Example reuse with @Mixin annotation.")
public class MyCommand {

    // adds the options defined in ReusableOptions to this command
    @Mixin
    private ReusableOptions myMixin;
}
```


### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-mixinStandardHelpOptions"></a> Standard Help Options
This release introduces the `mixinStandardHelpOptions` command attribute. When this attribute is set to `true`, picocli adds a mixin to the command that adds `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` options to the command. For example:

```java
@Command(mixinStandardHelpOptions = true, version = "auto help demo - picocli 3.0")
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```

Commands with `mixinStandardHelpOptions` do not need to explicitly declare fields annotated with `@Option(usageHelp = true)` and `@Option(versionHelp = true)` any more. The usage help message for the above example looks like this:
```text
Usage: <main class> [-hV] [--option=<option>]
      --option=<option>       Some option.
  -h, --help                  Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version               Print version information and exit.
```

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-HelpCommand"></a> Help Command

From this release, picocli provides a `help` subcommand (`picocli.CommandLine.HelpCommand`) that can be installed as a subcommand on any application command to provide usage help for the parent command or sibling subcommands. For example:

```java
@Command(subcommands = HelpCommand.class)
class AutoHelpDemo implements Runnable {

    @Option(names = "--option", description = "Some option.")
    String option;

    @Override public void run() { }
}
```


```text
# print help for the `maincommand` command
maincommand help

# print help for the `subcommand` command
maincommand help subcommand
```

For applications that want to create a custom help command, this release also introduces a new interface `picocli.CommandLine.IHelpCommandInitializable` that provides custom help commands with the information they need: access to the parent command and sibling commands, whether to use Ansi colors or not, and the streams to print the usage help message to.

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-Unmatched"></a> `@Unmatched` Annotation
From this release, fields annotated with `@Unmatched` will be populated with the unmatched arguments.
The field must be of type `String[]` or `List<String>`.

If picocli finds a field annotated with `@Unmatched`, it automatically sets `unmatchedArgumentsAllowed` to `true`
so no `UnmatchedArgumentException` is thrown when a command line argument cannot be assigned to an option or positional parameter.

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-std"></a> Stdout or Stderr
From picocli v3.0, the `run` and `call` convenience methods follow unix conventions:
print to stdout when the user requested help, and print to stderr when the input was invalid or an unexpected error occurred.

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to facilitate following this convention.
`AbstractHandler` also provides `useOut` and `useErr` methods to allow customizing the target output streams,
and `useAnsi` to customize the Ansi style to use:

```java
@Command class CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { ... }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new CustomizeTargetStreamsDemo());

        PrintStream myOut = getOutputPrintStream(); // custom stream to send command output to
        PrintStream myErr = getErrorPrintStream();  // custom stream for error messages

        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().useOut(myOut).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.ON),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().useErr(myErr).useAnsi(Help.Ansi.OFF),
                args);
    }
}
```

### <a name="3.0.0-alpha-1-exit-code"></a> Exit Code Support
From picocli v3.0, the built-in parse result handlers (`RunFirst`, `RunLast` and `RunAll`) and exception handler
(`DefaultExceptionHandler`) can specify an exit code.
If an exit code was specified, the handler terminates the JVM with the specified status code when finished.

```java
@Command class ExitCodeDemo implements Runnable {
    public void run() { throw new ParameterException(new CommandLine(this), "exit code demo"); }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new ExitCodeDemo());
        cmd.parseWithHandlers(
                new RunLast().andExit(123),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler().andExit(456),
                args);
    }
}
```
Running this command prints the following to stderr and exits the JVM with status code `456`.

```
exit code demo
Usage: <main class>
```

Custom handlers can extend `AbstractHandler` to inherit this behaviour.


### Fine-grained ShowDefault

This release adds a `showDefaultValue` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameters` annotation. This allows you to specify for each individual option and positional parameter whether its default value should be shown in the usage help.

This attribute accepts three values:

* `ALWAYS` - always display the default value of this option or positional parameter, even `null` values, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `NEVER` - don't show the default value for this option or positional parameter, regardless what value of `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command
* `ON_DEMAND` - (this is the default) only show the default value for this option or positional parameter if `showDefaultValues` was specified on the command

The `NEVER` value is useful for security sensitive command line arguments like passwords. The `ALWAYS` value is useful when you only want to show the default value for a few arguments but not for all (in combination with `@Command(showDefaultValues = false)`).

# <a name="2.3.0"></a> Picocli 2.3.0
The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.3.0.

This release contains bugfixes and new features.

This release introduces a new parser flag `stopAtPositional` to treat the first positional parameter as end-of-options, and a `stopAtUnmatched` parser flag to stop matching options and positional parameters as soon as an unmatched argument is encountered.

These flags are useful for applications that need to delegate part of the command line to third party commands.

This release offers better support for options with optional values, allowing applications to distinguish between cases where the option was not specified at all, and cases where the option was specified without a value.


This is the twentieth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

* [Potential breaking changes](#2.3.0-breaking-changes)

## <a name="2.3.0-new"></a> New and noteworthy

### Stop At Positional
By default, positional parameters can be mixed with options on the command line, but this is not always desirable. From this release, applications can call `CommandLine.setStopAtPositional(true)` to force the parser to treat all values following the first positional parameter as positional parameters.

When this flag is set, the first positional parameter effectively serves as an "end of options" marker, without requiring a separate `--` argument.

### Stop At Unmatched
From this release, applications can call `CommandLine.setStopAtUnmatched(true)` to force the parser to stop interpreting options and positional parameters as soon as it encounters an unmatched argument.

When this flag is set, the first unmatched argument and all subsequent command line arguments are added to the unmatched arguments list returned by `CommandLine.getUnmatchedArguments()`.


### Optional Values
If an option is defined with `arity = "0..1"`, it may or not have a parameter value. If such an option is specified without a value on the command line, it is assigned an empty String. If the option is not specified, it keeps its default value. For example:

```java
class OptionalValueDemo implements Runnable {
    @Option(names = "-x", arity = "0..1", description = "optional parameter")
    String x;

    public void run() { System.out.printf("x = '%s'%n", x); }

    public static void main(String... args) {
       CommandLine.run(new OptionalValueDemo(), System.out, args);
    }
}
```
Gives the following results:
```bash
java OptionalValueDemo -x value
x = 'value'

java OptionalValueDemo -x
x = ''

java OptionalValueDemo
x = 'null'
```

# <a name="2.2.0"></a> Picocli 2.2.0

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.2.

This release is a "Project Coin"-like release for picocli: small changes with a nice pay-off.


In command line applications with subcommands, options of the parent command are often intended as "global" options that apply to all the subcommands. This release introduces a new `@ParentCommand` annotation that makes it easy for subcommands to access such parent command options: fields of the subcommand annotated with `@ParentCommand` are initialized with a reference to the parent command. 

This release adds support for more built-in types, so applications don't need to register custom converters for common types. The new types include Java 7 classes like `java.nio.file.Path` and Java 8 classes like the value classes in the `java.time` package. These converters are loaded using reflection and are not available when running on Java 5 or Java 6.

This release also adds a `converter` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameter` annotations. This allows a specific option or positional parameter to use a different converter than would be used by default based on the type of the field.

Furthermore, the `@Command` annotation now supports a `versionProvider` attribute. This is useful when the version of an application should be detected dynamically at runtime. For example, an implementation may return version information obtained from the JAR manifest, a properties file or some other source.

Finally, applications may now specify a custom factory for instantiating classes that were configured as annotation attributes, like subcommands, type converters and version providers.



This is the seventeenth public release.

## <a name="2.2.0-new"></a> New and noteworthy

### New `@ParentCommand` annotation 

In command line applications with subcommands, options of the top level command are often intended as "global" options that apply to all the subcommands. Prior to this release, subcommands had no easy way to access their parent command options unless the parent command made these values available in a global variable.

The `@ParentCommand` annotation makes it easy for subcommands to access their parent command options: subcommand fields annotated with `@ParentCommand` are initialized with a reference to the parent command. For example:

```java
@Command(name = "fileutils", subcommands = List.class)
class FileUtils {

    @Option(names = {"-d", "--directory"},
            description = "this option applies to all subcommands")
    File baseDirectory;
}

@Command(name = "list")
class List implements Runnable {

    @ParentCommand
    private FileUtils parent; // picocli injects reference to parent command

    @Option(names = {"-r", "--recursive"}, 
            description = "Recursively list subdirectories")
    private boolean recursive;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        list(new File(parent.baseDirectory, "."));
    }

    private void list(File dir) {
        System.out.println(dir.getAbsolutePath());
        if (dir.isDirectory()) {
            for (File f : dir.listFiles()) {
                System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath());
                if (f.isDirectory() && recursive) {
                    list(f);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### More built-in types

This release adds support for more built-in types, so applications don't need to register custom converters for common types. The new types include Java 7 classes like `java.nio.file.Path` and Java 8 classes like the value classes in the `java.time` package. These converters are loaded using reflection and are not available when running on Java 5 or Java 6.

Converters for the following types were added in this release:

* `java.nio.file.Path` (requires Java 7 or higher)
* `java.time` value objects: `Duration`, `Instant`, `LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `LocalTime`, `MonthDay`, `OffsetDateTime`, `OffsetTime`, `Period`, `Year`, `YearMonth`, `ZonedDateTime`, `ZoneId`, `ZoneOffset`  (requires Java 8 or higher, invokes the `parse` method of these classes)
* `java.lang.Class` (for the fully qualified class name)
* `java.nio.ByteOrder` (for the Strings `"BIG_ENDIAN"` or `"LITTLE_ENDIAN"`)
* `java.util.Currency` (for the ISO 4217 code of the currency)
* `java.net.NetworkInterface` (for the InetAddress or name of the network interface)
* `java.util.TimeZoneConverter` (for the ID for a TimeZone)
* `java.sql.Connection` (for a database url of the form `jdbc:subprotocol:subname`)
* `java.sql.Driver` (for a database URL of the form `jdbc:subprotocol:subname`)
* `java.sql.Timestamp` (for values in the `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"` or `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fffffffff"` formats)

### Option-specific Type Converters
This release adds a `converter` attribute to the `@Option` and `@Parameter` annotations. This allows a specific option or positional parameter to use a different converter than would be used by default based on the type of the field.

For example, you may want to convert the constant names defined in [`java.sql.Types`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/sql/Types.html) to their `int` value for a specific field, but this should not impact any other `int` fields: other `int` fields should continue to use the default int converter that parses numeric values.

Example usage:

```java
class App {
    @Option(names = "--sqlType", converter = SqlTypeConverter.class)
    int sqlType;
}
```

Example implementation:

```java
class SqlTypeConverter implements ITypeConverter<Integer> {
    public Integer convert(String value) throws Exception {
        switch (value) {
            case "ARRAY"  : return Types.ARRAY;
            case "BIGINT" : return Types.BIGINT;
            case "BINARY" : return Types.BINARY;
            case "BIT"    : return Types.BIT;
            case "BLOB"   : return Types.BLOB;
            //...
        }
    }
}
```

### Dynamic Version Information
From this release, the `@Command` annotation supports a `versionProvider` attribute. Applications may specify a `IVersionProvider` implementation in this attribute, and picocli will instantiate this class
and invoke it to collect version information.

This is useful when the version of an application should be detected dynamically at runtime. For example, an implementation may return version information obtained from the JAR manifest, a properties file or some other source.

Custom version providers need to implement the `picocli.CommandLine.IVersionProvider` interface:

```java
public interface IVersionProvider {
    /**
     * Returns version information for a command.
     * @return version information (each string in the array is displayed on a separate line)
     * @throws Exception an exception detailing what went wrong when obtaining version information
     */
    String[] getVersion() throws Exception;
}
```

The GitHub project has a manifest file-based [example](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/picocli/examples/VersionProviderDemo2.java) and a build-generated version properties file-based [example](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/picocli/examples/VersionProviderDemo1.java) version provider implementation.

### Custom factory
Declaratively registered subcommands, type converters and version providers must be instantiated somehow. From this release, a custom factory can be specified when constructing a `CommandLine` instance. This allows full control over object creation and opens possibilities for Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. For example:

```jshelllanguage
IFactory myFactory = getCustomFactory();
CommandLine cmdLine = new CommandLine(new Git(), myFactory);
```

## <a name="2.2.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features

# <a name="2.1.0"></a> Picocli 2.1.0

This release contains bugfixes and new features.

Users sometimes run into system limitations on the length of a command line when creating a command line with lots of options or with long arguments for options.
Starting from this release, picocli supports "argument files" or "@-files". Argument files are files that themselves contain arguments to the command. When picocli encounters an argument beginning with the character `@', it expands the contents of that file into the argument list.

Secondly, this release adds support for multi-value boolean flags. A common use case where this is useful is to let users control the level of output verbosity by specifying more `-v` flags on the command line. For example, `-v` could give high-level output, `-vv` could show more detailed output, and `-vvv` could show debug-level information.

Finally, thanks to [aadrian](https://github.com/aadrian) and [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz), an `examples` subproject containing running examples has been added. (Your contributions are welcome!)
 
This is the sixteenth public release.

### Argument Files (`@`-files)
An argument file can include options and positional parameters in any combination. The arguments within a file can be space-separated or newline-separated. If an argument contains embedded whitespace, put the whole argument in double or single quotes (`"-f=My Files\Stuff.java"`).

Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored. The file may itself contain additional @-file arguments; any such arguments will be processed recursively.

Multiple @-files may be specified on the command line.

For example, suppose a file with arguments exists at `/home/foo/args`, with these contents:

```text
# This line is a comment and is ignored.
ABC -option=123
'X Y Z'
```

A command may be invoked with the @file argument, like this:
```bash
java MyCommand @/home/foo/args
```

The above will be expanded to the contents of the file:
```bash
java MyCommand ABC -option=123 "X Y Z"
```

This feature is similar to the 'Command Line Argument File' processing supported by gcc, javadoc and javac.
The documentation for these tools shows further examples.

### Repeated Boolean Flags

Multi-valued boolean options are now supported. For example:
```jshelllanguage
@Option(names = "-v", description = { "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.",
                                      "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`"})
boolean[] verbosity;
```

Users may specify multiple boolean flag options without parameters. For example:
```bash
<command> -v -v -v -vvv
```
The above example results in six `true` values being added to the `verbosity` array.


## <a name="2.1.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

No features have been promoted in this picocli release.

## <a name="2.1.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#126] New feature: Support expanding argument files, also called `@-files`.
- [#241] New feature (enhancing [#126]): Recursively process nested @-files; allow multiple arguments per line, allow quoted arguments with embedded whitespace.
- [#217] New feature: Support repeated boolean flag options captured in multi-valued fields.
- [#223] New feature: Added `examples` subproject containing running examples.  Thanks to [aadrian](https://github.com/aadrian) and [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#68]  Enhancement: Reject private final primitive fields annotated with @Option or @Parameters: because compile-time constants are inlined, updates by picocli to such fields would not be visible to the application.
- [#239] Enhancement: Improve error message when Exception thrown from Runnable/Callable.
- [#240] Bugfix: RunAll handler should return empty list, not null, when help is requested.
- [#244] Bugfix: the parser only considered `help` options instead of any of `help`, `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` to determine if missing required options can be ignored when encountering a subcommand. Thanks to [mkavanagh](https://github.com/mkavanagh).

## <a name="2.1.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations

The `Range::defaultArity(Class)` method is now deprecated in favour of the `Range::defaultArity(Field)` method introduced in v2.0.

## <a name="2.1.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

Private final fields that are either `String` or primitive types can no longer be annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`.
Picocli will throw an `InitializationException` when it detects such fields,
because compile-time constants are inlined, and updates by picocli to such fields would not be visible to the application.



# <a name="2.0.3"></a> Picocli 2.0.3

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.3.

This is a bugfix release that fixes a parser bug where the first argument following a clustered options was treated as a positional parameter, and removes the erroneous runtime dependency on `groovy-lang` that slipped in with the 2.0 release.

This release also includes a minor enhancement to support embedded newlines in usage help sections like header or descriptions. This allows Groovy applications to use [triple-quoted](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_triple_double_quoted_string) and [dollar slashy](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_dollar_slashy_string) multi-line strings in usage help sections.

This is the fifteenth public release.

# <a name="2.0"></a> Picocli 2.0

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.

First, picocli now provides tight integration for Groovy scripts.
The new `@picocli.groovy.PicocliScript` annotation allows Groovy scripts to use the `@Command` annotation,
and turns a Groovy script into a picocli-based command line application.
When the script is run, `@Field` variables annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`
are initialized from the command line arguments before the script body is executed.

Applications with subcommands will also benefit from upgrading to picocli 2.0.
The `CommandLine.run` and `CommandLine.call` methods now work for subcommands,
and if more flexibility is needed, take a look at the new `parseWithHandler` methods.
Error handling for subcommands has been improved in this release with the new `ParseException.getCommandLine` method.

Improved ease of use: Usage help is now printed automatically from the `CommandLine.run` and `CommandLine.call` methods
and from the built-in handlers used with the `parseWithHandler` method.

The parser has been improved and users can now mix positional arguments with options on the command line.
Previously, positional parameter had to follow the options.
**Important notice:** To make this feature possible, the default parsing behaviour of multi-value options and parameters changed to be non-greedy by default.

Finally, this release includes many [bug fixes](#2.0-fixes).

This is the twelfth public release.

## <a name="2.0-new"></a> New and noteworthy

### <a name="2.0-groovy-script"></a> Groovy Script Support
Picocli 2.0 introduces special support for Groovy scripts.

Scripts annotated with `@picocli.groovy.PicocliScript` are automatically transformed to use
`picocli.groovy.PicocliBaseScript` as their base class and can also use the `@Command` annotation to
customize parts of the usage message like command name, description, headers, footers etc.

Before the script body is executed, the `PicocliBaseScript` base class parses the command line and initializes
`@Field` variables annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`.
The script body is executed if the user input was valid and did not request usage help or version information.

```groovy
// exampleScript.groovy
@Grab('info.picocli:picocli:2.0.0')
@Command(name = "myCommand", description = "does something special")
@PicocliScript
import picocli.groovy.PicocliScript
import picocli.CommandLine.Command
import picocli.CommandLine.Option
import groovy.transform.Field

@Option(names = "-x", description = "number of repetitions")
@Field int count;

@Option(names = ["-h", "--help"], usageHelp = true, description = "print this help message and exit")
@Field boolean helpRequested;

//if (helpRequested) { // not necessary: PicocliBaseScript takes care of this
//    CommandLine.usage(this, System.err); return 0;
//}
count.times {
   println "hi"
}
// the CommandLine that parsed the args is available as a property
assert this.commandLine.commandName == "myCommand"
```

### <a name="2.0-subcommands"></a> Better Subcommand Support
New methods `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` were added. These methods intend to offer the same ease of use as 
the `run` and `call` methods, but with more flexibility and better support for nested subcommands.

The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand 
specified by the user. (Previously subcommands were ignored and only the top-level command was executed.)

From this release, picocli exceptions provide a `getCommandLine` method 
that returns the command or subcommand where parsing or execution failed.
Previously, if the user provided invalid input for applications with subcommands,
it was difficult to pinpoint exactly which subcommand failed to parse the input.

### <a name="2.0-ease-of-use"></a> Easier To Use
The convenience methods will automatically print usage help and version information
when the user specifies options annotated with the `versionHelp` or `usageHelp` attributes.

Methods that automatically print help:

* CommandLine::call
* CommandLine::run
* CommandLine::parseWithHandler (with the built-in Run…​ handlers)
* CommandLine::parseWithHandlers (with the built-in Run…​ handlers)

Methods that do not automatically print help:

* CommandLine::parse
* CommandLine::populateCommand

Also notable: Collection and Map fields no longer require the `type` annotation attribute: 
picocli now infers the conversion target type from the generic type parameters where possible.

### <a name="2.0-parser-improvements"></a> Parser Improvements 
Positional parameters can now be mixed with options on the command line. Previously, positional parameter had to follow the options.

To make this feature possible, the default parsing behaviour of multi-value options and parameters changed to be non-greedy by default.

### <a name="2.0-help-improvements"></a> Usage Help Format Improvements
This release contains various bugfixes related to improving the usage help format for multi-value options and collections.
For example, for Maps that don't have a `paramLabel`, picocli now shows key type and value type instead of the internal Java field name.

## <a name="2.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

The following are the features that have been promoted in this picocli release.

* Autocomplete - as of picocli 2.0, autocompletion is no longer beta.

## <a name="2.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#207] API Change: Provide ability to find which subcommand threw a ParameterException API enhancement. Thanks to [velit](https://github.com/velit) and [AshwinJay](https://github.com/AshwinJay).
- [#179] API Change to remove full JRE dependency and require only Compact Profile. Replace use of `java.awt.Point` with `picocli.CommandLine.Help.TextTable.Cell`. Thanks to [webfolderio](https://github.com/webfolderio).
- [#205] API Change: `CommandLine::getCommand` now returns a generic type instead of Object so client code can avoid type casting.
- [#196] API Change: `Option::type()` and `Parameters::type()` now return empty array by default (was `{String.class}`).
- [#210] API Change: Deprecated the option `help` attribute in favour of the `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` attributes.
- [#115] New feature: Added new `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` convenience methods for commands with subcommands.
- [#130] New feature: Options and positional parameters can now be mixed on the command line.
- [#196] New feature: Infer type from collections and maps when `type` annotation not specified. Thanks to [ddimtirov](https://github.com/ddimtirov) for the suggestion.
- [#197] New feature: Use `type` attribute to determine conversion target type instead of field type. This allows fields to be declared as interfaces or abstract types (or arrays/collections/maps of these) and via the `type` attribute picocli will be able to convert String arguments to concrete implementation objects.
- [#187] New feature: Added methods to programmatically get and set the command name.
- [#192] Bugfix: Default arity should be 1, not *, for array and collection options. Thanks to [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#193] Bugfix: Splitting an argument should not cause max arity to be exceeded.
- [#191] Bugfix: Arity should not limit the total number of values put in an array or collection. Thanks to [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#186] Bugfix: Confusing usage message for collection options. Thanks to [AlexFalappa](https://github.com/AlexFalappa).
- [#181] Bugfix: Incorrect help message was displayed for short options with paramLabel when arity > 1.
- [#184] Bugfix/Enhancement: Programmatically setting the separator is now reflected in the usage help message. Thanks to [defnull](https://github.com/defnull).
- [#200] Bugfix: Prevent NPE when command name is set to empty string or spaces. Thanks to [jansohn](https://github.com/jansohn).
- [#203] Bugfix: Empty string parameter parsed incorrectly. Thanks to [AshwinJay](https://github.com/AshwinJay).
- [#194] Enhancement: Usage help should show split regex for option/parameters.
- [#198] Enhancement: Usage help parameter list details should indicate arity for positional parameters.
- [#195] Enhancement: Usage help should show Map types if paramLabel not specified.
- [#183] Enhancement: Add examples to user manual for using picocli in other JVM languages. Thanks to [binkley](https://github.com/binkley) for pointing out that Kotlin may support array literals in annotations from 1.2.
- [#185] Enhancement: Exception message text for missing options should not use field names but be more descriptive and consistent with usage help. Thanks to [AlexFalappa](https://github.com/AlexFalappa).
- [#201] Enhancement: Usage help should not show `null` default values. Thanks to [jansohn](https://github.com/jansohn).
- [#202] Enhancement: Java 9: add `Automatic-Module-Name: info.picocli` to MANIFEST.MF to make picocli play nice in the Java 9 module system.
- [#204] Enhancement: instantiate `LinkedHashSet` instead of `HashSet` for `Set` fields to preserve input ordering.
- [#208] Enhancement: Remove pom.xml, which was not being maintained. Picocli can only be built with gradle going forward.
- [#212] Enhancement: Improve javadoc for picocli.AutoComplete.

## <a name="2.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations
The `help` attribute for options is now deprecated. Please change to use `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` attributes instead.
From picocli v2.0, the convenience methods will automatically print usage help and version information
when requested with the `versionHelp` and `usageHelp` option attributes (but not for the `help` attribute).


## <a name="2.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

This release has a number of incompatible changes:
* Multi-value options (array, list and map fields) are **not greedy by default** any more.
* **Arity is not max values**: end users may specify multi-value options (array, list and map fields) an unlimited number of times.
* A single argument that is split into parts with a regex now **counts as a single argument** (so `arity="1"` won't prevent all parts from being added to the field)
* API change: replaced `java.awt.Point` with custom `Cell` class as return value type for public method `Help.TextTable.putValue()`.
* API change: `@Option.type()` and `@Parameters.type()` now return an empty array by default (was `{String.class}`).
* API change: `ParameterException` and all subclasses now require a `CommandLine` object indicating the command or subcommand that the user provided invalid input for.
* The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand specified by the user. Previously subcommands were ignored and the top-level command was executed unconditionally.

I am not happy about the disruption these changes may cause, but I felt they were needed for three reasons:
the old picocli v1.0 behaviour caused ambiguity in common use cases,
was inconsistent with most Unix tools, 
and prevented supporting mixing options with positional arguments on the command line.

To illustrate the new non-greedy behaviour, consider this example program:
```java
class MixDemo {
  @Option(names="-o") List<String> options;
  @Parameters         List<String> positionalParams;

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("positional: " + positionalParams);
    System.out.println("options   : " + options);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CommandLine.run(new MixDemo(), System.err, args);
  }
}
```
We run this program as below, where the option is followed by multiple values:

```bash
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3
```

Previously, the arguments following `-o` would all end up in the `options` list. Running the above command with picocli 1.0 would print out the following:

```bash
# (Previously, in picocli-1.0.1)
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3

positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
```

From picocli 2.0, only the first argument following `-o` is added to the `options` list, the remainder is parsed as positional parameters:

```bash
# (Currently, in picocli-2.0)
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3

positional: [2, 3]
options   : [1]
```

To put multiple values in the options list in picocli 2.0, users can specify the `-o` option multiple times:
```bash
$ java MixDemo -o 1 -o 2 -o 3

positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
```

Alternatively, application authors can make a multi-value option greedy in picocli v2.0 by explicitly setting a variable arity:
```java
class Args {
    @Option(names = "-o", arity = "1..*") List<String> options;
}
```
(... "greedy" means consume until the next option, so not necessarily all remaining command line arguments.)

Non-breaking changes to support Callable commands, Map options and format specifiers in version help.

This is the tenth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="1.0.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

* [#121] New feature: command line autocompletion. Picocli can generate bash and zsh completion scripts that allow the shell to generate potential completion matches based on the `@Option` and `@Command` annotations in your application. After this script is installed, the shell will show the options and subcommands available in your java command line application, and in some cases show possible option values.
* [#67] New feature: Map options like `-Dkey1=val1 -Dkey2=val2`. Both key and value can be strongly typed (not just Strings).
* [#158] New feature: parser TRACING for easy troubleshooting. The trace level can be controlled with a system property.
* [#170] New feature: added `call` convenience method similar to `run`. Applications whose main business logic may throw an exception or returns a result can now implement `Callable` and reduce some boilerplate code.
* [#149] Parser now throws UnmatchedArgumentException for args that resemble options but are not, instead of treating like them positional parameters. Thanks to [giaco777](https://github.com/giaco777).
* [#172] Parser now throws MaxValuesforFieldExceededException when multi-valued option or parameters max arity exceeded
* [#173] Parser now throws UnmatchedArgumentException when not all positional parameters are assigned to a field
* [#171] WARN when option overwritten with different value (when isOverwrittenOptionsAllowed=true); WARN for unmatched args (when isUnmatchedArgumentsAllowed=true). Thanks to [ddimtirov](https://github.com/ddimtirov).
* [#164] API change: Support format patterns in version string and printVersionHelp
* [#167] API change: Change `type` attribute from `Class` to `Class[]`. This was needed for Map options support.
* [#168] API change: `CommandLine::setSeparator` method now returns this CommandLine (was void), allowing for chained method calls.
* [#156] Added example to user manual to clarify main command common usage. Thanks to [nagkumar](https://github.com/nagkumar).
* [#166] Fixed bug where adjacent markup sections resulted in incorrect ANSI escape sequences
* [#174] Fixed bug where under some circumstances, unmatched parameters were added to UnmatchedParameters list twice

# <a name="0.9.7"></a> 0.9.7 - Bugfix and enhancements release for public review. API may change.

## <a name="0.9.7-summary"></a> Summary

Version 0.9.7 has some breaking API changes.

**Better Groovy support**

It was [pointed out](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/135) that Groovy had trouble distinguishing between
the static `parse(Object, String...)` method and the instance method `parse(String...)`.

To address this, the static `parse(Object, String...)` method has been renamed
to `populateCommand(Object, String...)` in  version 0.9.7.

**Nested subcommands**

* Version 0.9.7 adds support for [nested sub-subcommands](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/127)
* `CommandLine::parse` now returns `List<CommandLine>` (was `List<Object>`)
* `CommandLine::getCommands` now returns `Map<String, CommandLine>` (was `Map<String, Object>`)
* renamed method `CommandLine::addCommand` to `addSubcommand`
* renamed method `CommandLine::getCommands` to `getSubcommands`

**Miscellaneous**

Renamed class `Arity` to `Range` since it is not just used for @Option and @Parameters `arity` but also for `index` in positional @Parameters.
