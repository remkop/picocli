# By calling the ./runCompletion script (or runtest --tool=completion),
# we ensure the tests are driven by the dejagnu framework:
#
# Before this script is invoked:
# * proc completion_init in dejagnu.tests/lib/completion.exp is called;
# * the first time completion_init is called, completion_start is called;
# * this in turn starts a bash session and initializes it to give predictable behaviour:
#   (see dejagnu.tests/config/bashrc and dejagnu.tests/config/inputrc for details)
#
# Next, this script is called:
# 1. source the completion script
# 2. call proc assert_source_completions in dejagnu.tests/lib/library.exp (line 420)
#    This verifies that _some_ completion for the specified command is defined, and then
# 3. executes the dejagnu.tests/lib/completions/$cmd.exp script.
#    This lib/completions/$cmd.exp script is where the completions are verified.
