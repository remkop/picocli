Every main method deserves picocli!

== Introduction
Picocli-based applications can now have command line completion in Bash or Zsh Unix shells.
Picocli can generate an autocompletion script tailored to your application.

With this script installed, users can type the first few letters of a subcommand or an option,
then press the TAB key, and the Unix shell will complete the subcommand or option.

In the case of multiple possible completions, the Unix shell will display all subcommands or options beginning
with those few characters. The user can type more characters and press TAB again to see a new, narrowed-down
list if the typed characters are still ambiguous, or else complete the subcommand or option.

== Command Line Completion Example
Assume we have a picocli-based command line application with subcommands, all of which have some options. Below is an example:

[source,java]
----
import picocli.CommandLine.Command;
import picocli.CommandLine.Option;
import picocli.CommandLine.Parameters;

@Command(name = "hierarchy", subcommands = { Subcommand1.class, Subcommand2.class })
class MainCommand {
    @Option(names = {"-V", "--version"}, help = true) boolean versionRequested;
    @Option(names = {"-h", "--help"},    help = true) boolean helpRequested;
}

@Command(name = "sub1", description = "subcommand 1")
class Subcommand1 {
    @Option(names = {"--directory", "-d"}, description = "a directory") File directory;
    @Option(names = {"-h", "--host"},      description = "a host")      InetAddress host;
}

@Command(name = "sub2", description = "subcommand 2")
class Subcommand2 {
    @Option(names = {"-u", "--timeUnit"}) private TimeUnit timeUnit;
    @Option(names = {"-t", "--timeout"})  private long timeout;
}
----

Assume we <<Generating the Completion Script,generated>> and <<Installing the Completion Script,installed>> a completion script for this application. Assume the command script to run the application is called `hierarchy`.

=== Options and Subcommands
After the command name, press the TAB key to trigger autocomplete. The shell will show all options and all subcommands for the `hierarchy` main command:

[source,bash]
----
$ hierarchy <TAB><TAB>
-h         --help     sub1       sub2       -V         --version
----

=== Partial Input
If the option or subcommand is partially specified, a narrowed-down list is shown. For example, after typing 's' and triggering autocomplete, only the completion options starting with 's' are shown:
[source,bash]
----
$ hierarchy s<TAB><TAB>
sub1  sub2
----

=== Context-sensitive

Picocli autocomplete is context-sensitive to the selected subcommand and the selected option.

After selecting a subcommand, the user can hit <TAB><TAB> again to see what options are available on that subcommand. Only the options for the selected subcommand are shown:

[source,bash]
----
$ hierarchy sub1 <TAB><TAB>
-d           --directory  --h       --host
----

=== Nested sub-subcommands
There is no restriction to the number of levels for nested subcommands. The completion script generated by picocli will show context-sensitive matches for the most specific (deepest) subcommand.

=== Option Values
In addition to showing a list of option _names_, tab completion can also generate possible option _values_. The type of the field annotated with `@Option` determines the generated values.

Picocli can generate completion matches for the following types:

* `java.io.File`
* `java.nio.file.Path`
* `java.net.InetAddress`
* any java `enum`

==== Files and Directories
In the above example, `Subcommand1` has a `java.io.File` field annotated with `@Option(names = {"--directory", "-d"}`. Generating autocomplete matches for that option will display a list of all files and directories in the current directory.
[source,bash]
----
$ hierarchy sub1 -d <TAB><TAB>
basic.bash              hierarchy               nestedSubcommands.bash
----

The same tab completion matches are shown for fields of type `java.nio.file.Path` annotated with `@Option`.

==== Host Names
In the above example, `Subcommand1` has a `java.net.InetAddress` field annotated with `@Option(names = {"-h", "--host"}`. Generating autocomplete matches for that option will display a list of known hosts.
[source,bash]
----
$ hierarchy sub1 --host <TAB><TAB>
cluster-p-1                          openvpn-client.myvpn.picocli.com
cluster-p-2                          picop1
cluster-p-3                          picop2
cluster-p-4                          picop3
cluster-scm-1                        picop4
client.openvpn.net                   picoscm1
----

==== Java `enum` Values
In the above example, `Subcommand2` has a field of type `java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit`, which is a Java `enum`.  Generating autocomplete matches for that option will display the list of enum values.

[source,bash]
----
$ hierarchy sub2 --timeUnit <TAB><TAB>
DAYS     HOURS     MICROSECONDS  MILLISECONDS  MINUTES    NANOSECONDS   SECONDS
----

== Generating the Completion Script

Create a `CommandLine` instance with the full hierarchy of nested subcommands.
[source,java]
----
CommandLine hierarchy = new CommandLine(new TopLevel())
        .addSubcommand("sub1", new Subcommand1())
        .addSubcommand("sub2", new Subcommand2());
----

Pass this `CommandLine` instance and the name of the script to the `picocli.AutoComplete::bash` method. The method will return the source code of a completion script. Save the source code to a file and install it.

CAUTION: *_The AutoComplete class is not yet in master but can be checked out from the https://github.com/remkop/picocli/tree/%23121-autocomplete[autocomplete branch]._*

[source,bash]
----
String script = AutoComplete.bash("hierarchy", hierarchy);
// save to file
----

TODO 1) Save the generated completion script to a file

TODO 2) generate the accompanying `hierarchy` command script to run the application. This is the script that Bash will recognize and generate completion matches for. It needs to contain something like

[source,bash]
----
// file: 'hierarchy'
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HIERARCHY_DIR=path/to/libs
HIERARCHY_CP="${HIERARCHY_DIR}/myApp.jar"
java -cp "${HIERARCHY_CP}" 'com.myorg.myproject.MainClass' $@
----

== Installing the Completion Script in Bash

Make sure bash completion is installed.

Place the completion script file in `/etc/bash_completion.d` (or `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d` on a Mac). If `bash-completion` is installed, placing the completion script in either of these directories should be sufficient. (Source your `~/.bash_profile` or launch a new terminal to start using this completion script.)

Alternatively, make a directory `mkdir ~/bash_completion.d`, and place the completion script in this directory. Edit your `~/.bashrc` file and add the following:

[source,bash]
----
for bcfile in ~/bash_completion.d/* ; do
  . $bcfile
done
----

Source your `~/.bash_profile` or launch a new terminal to start using this completion script.


== Installing the Completion Script in ZSH

Zsh can handle bash completions functions. The latest development version of zsh has a function bashcompinit, that when run will allow zsh to read bash completion specifications and functions. This is documented in the zshcompsys man page. To use it all you need to do is run bashcompinit at any time after compinit. It will define complete and compgen functions corresponding to the bash builtins.

Make a directory `mkdir ~/bash_completion.d`, and place the completion script in this directory. Edit your `~/.zshrc` file and add the following:

[source,bash]
----
autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
for bcfile in ~/bash_completion.d/* ; do
  . $bcfile
done
----

Then reload your shell:

[source,bash]
----
exec $SHELL -l
----
